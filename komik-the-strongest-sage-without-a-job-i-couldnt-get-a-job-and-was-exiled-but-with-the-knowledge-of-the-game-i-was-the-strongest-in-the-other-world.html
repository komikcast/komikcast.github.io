                                            The Beauty of KupangLast vacation, I went to Kupang. At first, I thought the place was only the same as otherplaces in NTT. But I was very surprised to find that it was the most beautiful place I've ever visited.There were a fantastic meadow, a lake and a river. The meadow was very large. In themiddle of the meadow, there were many cows and sheep. All the animals were fat and healthybecause they could easily get some grass in the large meadow. At the edge of the meadow, therewas a small river. The water in the river was very cold but the sound of the streaming water wasgood to be heard, especially in the evening.Not far away from the cattle, there was a lake. The lake was not too big, but it was verybeautiful. The water was very clear and clean. I could see many fish in the lake. The most amazingthing was the water itself. It was not cold although the weather around was extremely freezing.Unfortunately, I stayed there for just three days because we had to go back to Ende. But,have promised myself to come back again later.2.What is the writer's intention in writing the text?​</a>

But I was very surprised to find that it was the most beautiful place I've ever visited.There were a fantastic meadow, a lake and a river. The meadow was very large. In themiddle of the meadow, there were many cows and sheep. All the animals were fat and healthybecause they could easily get some grass in the large meadow. At the edge of the meadow, therewas a small river. The water in the river was very cold but the sound of the streaming water wasgood to be heard, especially in the evening.Not far away from the cattle, there was a lake. The lake was not too big, but it was verybeautiful. The water was very clear and clean. I could see many fish in the lake. The most amazingthing was the water itself. It was not cold although the weather around was extremely freezing.Unfortunately, I stayed there for just three days because we had to go back to Ende. But,have promised myself to come back again later.2.What is the writer's intention in writing the text?​</h2><br />
