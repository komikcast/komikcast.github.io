If we talk about the Wonders of the World buildings, then we will see Eiffel Tower as one of them. However many of us do not know the tower’s past history on why it was build. Everything has the reasonable background, especially for the tower which is to be one of the most recognized buildings in the world.
Primarily, the Eiffel Tower was built for the World Exhibition. It was called Paris Exposition in 1889. The exhibition was organized to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. The purpose of building Eiffel Tower in such structure was to show to the world France’s advancement of technology and beauty. The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel. It seemed that then the name of the tower was derived from the designer’s last name, “Eiffel”
Another reason on why the tower was built was for scientific progress. Although few realized it, the Eiffel Tower would become the prominent structure in terms of science and technology. Many experiment with temperature, pressure and pendulums were performed atop the unique famous building. Additionally the Eiffel Tower was used for radio transmission tower. Many experiments were conducted atop the Eiffel Tower for radio transmission advancement. Once the Eiffel Tower was proposed to be demolished but it was spared because the tower had the promising future as a radio tower.</a>

Apart from being a symbol of the city, the existence of the gadang clock is also used as a tourist attraction that can attract tourists. It turns out that behind the splendor of the gadang clock, there is history in its manufacture.</p><p></p><p>According to several historical figures, the jam gadang was built in 1926 during the reign of the Dutch East Indies as a gift from the Queen of the Netherlands to Rook Maker, a secretary from the city of Bukittingi. The design of this clock gadang was designed by an architect named Yazid Rajo Mangkuto. Its construction is estimated to cost up to 3,000 Guilders which is a very large expense at that time.</p><p></p><p>The Clock Tower was made by several workers and took quite a long time. In addition to the size of the tower which is high and large, the length of time and costs incurred have also become the center of attention of many people so that the Jam Gadang tower is starting to be widely known by people.</p><p></p><p>The person who laid the first stone when the construction of the Jam Gadang tower was completed was the Rook Maker who was 6 years old at that time and was a symbol that the Clock Tower had been officially given to the city of Bukittinggi and served as a marker and also the zero point of the city.</p><p></p><p>Since its establishment until now, the clock tower has been changed several times, especially in the shape of the roof. When the tower was first built, during the Dutch East Indies era, the roof of the tower was round with a statue of a rooster on it facing east.</p><p></p><p>Then when Indonesia was colonized by Japan, the roof of the tower was changed into a shape like a pagoda, finally after Indonesia became independent, the tower was then converted into a shape like the custom of a Minangkabau house to become a symbol of the Minangkabau tribe.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Clock Tower has also been renovated by the Bukittinggi city government in collaboration with the Indonesian Heritage Preservation Agency (BPPI) and the Dutch-Indonesian embassy. Until now, the Clock Tower tower continues to be maintained and preserved its existence.</p><p></p><p>lamps as lighting at night or in the dark, providing a source of energy, giving life to entertainment facilities as well as in cafes using a lot of lights, providing heat, generating motion and many others...</p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan :)</strong></p><p><strong>semoga membantu :)</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>The original purpose of building the tower is commonly attributed to the Tower of Babel, which is a biblical account found in the Book of Genesis. According to the story, the people of the world at that time spoke a single language and decided to build a tower that would reach the heavens. They aimed to make a name for themselves and prevent their dispersal across the Earth.</p><p></p><p>The Tower of Babel was seen as a symbol of human pride and disobedience towards God. As a result, God confused their language, causing them to speak in different tongues, and scattered them across the world. This event also explains the origin of various languages.</p><p></p><p>However, it's worth noting that there are different interpretations and perspectives regarding the purpose and symbolism of the Tower of Babel in different cultures and religions.</p><br />
