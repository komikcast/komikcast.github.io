There she bought a mouse trap. The shopkeeper said to her, "put some cheese in it. And you will soon catch a mouse".
Mrs. Steele went home with her mouse trap, but when she looked in her cupboard, she could not find any cheese in it. She did not want to go back to the shops, because it was very late. Then she got an idea. She cut a picture of some cheese out of a magazine and put that in the trap.
Surprisingly, the picture of the cheese was quite successful. When Mrs. Steele carne down to the kitchen in the next morning, there was a picture of a mouse in the trap beside the picture of the cheese.

Report Tex The Venus Fly Trap Venus fly trap is a carnivorous plant that catches, di- gest, and animal preymostly insects and arachnids . Its trapping structure is formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves and is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contracts a hair, the trap closes if a different hair is contacted nutritional value within twenty seconds of the first strike. Mechanism of trapping 10. The mechanism by which the trap snaps shut involves a complex interaction between elasticity, turgor and growth. In the open, untripped state, the lobes are convex (bent outwards), but in the closed state, the lobes are concave (forming a cavity) Digestion If the prey is unable to escape, it will continue to stimulate the inner surface of the lobes, and this causes a further growth response the forces the edges of the lobes together, eventually sealing the trap hermetically and forming a stomach in which digestion occurs. Enzymes secreted by glands in the lobes catalyze digestion. The venus is found in nitrogen, and phospho rus poor environments such as bogs and we savannah. Small in stature and slow growing, the venus fly trap tolerates fire well, and depends on periodic burning to suppres its competition. Fire suppresion threatens its future in the wild. It survives in wet sandy and pea soils. Although it has been successfully transplanted and grown in many locales around the world, it is found natively only in North and South Caro- lina in the United States, specifically within a 60 mile radius of Wilmington, Carolina.

Carnivorous plants, such as the sundew and the Venus – flytrap, are generally found in humid areas where there is an inadequate supply of nitrogen in the soil. In order to survive, these plants have developed mechanisms to trap insects within their foliage. They have digestive fluids to obtain the necessary nitrogen from the insects.
These plants trap the insects in a variety of ways. The sundew has sticky hairs on its leaves; when an insects lands on these leaves, it gets caught up in the sticky hairs, and the leaf wraps it self around the insect.
	The leaves of the Venus-flytrap function more likely a trap, snapping suddenly and forcefully shut around an insect.

                                            artikan carnivorous plants, such as the sundew and the Venus – flytrap, are generally found in humid areas where there is an inadequate supply of nitrogen in the soil. In order to survive, these plants have developed mechanisms to trap insects within their foliage. They have digestive fluids to obtain the necessary nitrogen from the insects.
These plants trap the insects in a variety of ways. The sundew has sticky hairs on its leaves; when an insects lands on these leaves, it gets caught up in the sticky hairs, and the leaf wraps it self around the insect.
The leaves of the Venus-flytrap function more likely a trap, snapping suddenly and forcefully shut around an insect.</a>

When an insect sits on it to drink the nectar, it slides down the rim. When the insect reaches the bottom, it gets drowned in a power ful liquid that digests the insect and provides food for the plant.Another plant is Sundew. The plan traps the insect with the help of little hair-like projections which cover the upper part of the leaves. When an insect touches it, it is stuck. Venus fly trap is another plant- eating insects. When a fly touches the hair that grows along the leaf, the plant shut itself like a trap. After the fly is di gested by juices in the plan, it opens up again. We see that plants are not always harmless.17. The plant is harmless....The underlined word is the opposite of ....a. Pureb.

                        <p>The tone of the song above is <strong>happy (A). </strong>The song’s tittle that related to this question is Outdoors by Jason Mraz.</p>Pembahasan<p>Jawaban yang benar untuk soal di atas adalah <strong>happy (A) </strong>sebab suasana dari lagu <strong>Outdoors Jason Mraz</strong> memang riang gembira dan menyenangkan. Namun agar lebih yakin dengan jawaban terpilih, silahkan simak uraian semua opsi jawaban yang ada berikut ini:</p><strong>A. TRUE</strong>. Jawaban ini benar karena suasana (tone) lagu dari Outdoors yang dibawakan Jason Mraz memang diiringi dengan nada-nada musik yang ceria yang sama persis dengan musik yang mengiringi lagu <strong>‘I’m Yours’.</strong><strong>B. FALSE.</strong> Jawaban ini salah, musik pengiring lagu Outdoors adalah musik yang bahagia, ceria dan riang gembira. Musik ini disesuaikan dengan lirik lagu yang juga mengandung letupan semangat seseorang untuk memulai hari baru, berjalan-jalan ke luar di mana udara segar menyambut dan hangat matahari memeluk.<strong>C. FALSE.</strong> Jawaban ini salah, nada pada lagu Outdoors sangat riang dan membangkitkan rasa senang. Nadanya cepat dan menggunakan suara petikan gitar sebagai instrumen utama. Nada lagu jelas tidak melankolis, tidak lambat dan tidak mengandung perasaan muram atau sedih.<strong>D. FALSE. </strong>Nada lagu <strong>Outdoors </strong>justru mengandung semangat dan kegembiraan dalam menyongsong hari. Liriknya mengajak kita untuk keluar rumah menghirup udara segar dan menyapa matahari. Nada lagu tidak membuai seseorang dalam kemalasan atau rasa murung.<strong>E. FALSE.</strong> Jawaban salah. Jenis musik pada lagu Outdoors memang melodis karena diiringi petikan gitar. Namun fokus pertanyaan adalah suasana yang muncul dari lagu yang dibawakan.<p><strong>Catatan:</strong></p><p>Soal ini dijumpai dalam bahasa Inggris untuk SMA kelas 2 dan pembuat soal <strong>gagal membedakan</strong> antara<strong> ‘tone of the song’ </strong>dan ‘<strong>mood of the song’.</strong> Istilah musik yang sesuai dengan soal dan pilihannya di atas sebenarnya adalah mood atau suasana yang dimunculkan lagu yakni gembira (happy). Namun istilah yang mereka pakai malah ‘tone’ yang tidak diartikan sebagai suasana melainkan digambarkan sebagai warna atau timbre dari nada. Istilah yang digunakan menggambarkan tone lagu adalah ‘dark’, ‘warm’, ‘lush’, ‘strident’, ‘shrill’, ‘ringing’, ‘brilliant’ dan lain sebagainya.</p>Pelajari Lebih LanjutMateri tentang perasaan yang muncul saat menyanyikan lagu Indonesia Raya https://brainly.co.id/tugas/21654278Materi tentang apa yang dimaksud dengan lagu daerah https://brainly.co.id/tugas/601276Materi tentang isi dari lagu berjudul 'awan putih' https://brainly.co.id/tugas/26400480<p>• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •</p>Detail Jawaban<p><strong>Kelas      : 2 SMA</strong></p><p><strong>Mapel    : Bahasa Inggris</strong></p><p><strong>Bab        : -</strong></p><p><strong>Kode      : -</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#AyoBelajar</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                            39. Report Tex The Venus Fly Trap Venus fly trap is a carnivorous plant that catches, di- gest, and animal preymostly insects and arachnids . Its trapping structure is formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves and is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contracts a hair, the trap closes if a different hair is contacted nutritional value within twenty seconds of the first strike. Mechanism of trapping 10. The mechanism by which the trap snaps shut involves a complex interaction between elasticity, turgor and growth. In the open, untripped state, the lobes are convex (bent outwards), but in the closed state, the lobes are concave (forming a cavity) Digestion If the prey is unable to escape, it will continue to stimulate the inner surface of the lobes, and this causes a further growth response the forces the edges of the lobes together, eventually sealing the trap hermetically and forming a stomach in which digestion occurs. Enzymes secreted by glands in the lobes catalyze digestion. The venus is found in nitrogen, and phospho rus poor environments such as bogs and we savannah. Small in stature and slow growing, the venus fly trap tolerates fire well, and depends on periodic burning to suppres its competition. Fire suppresion threatens its future in the wild. It survives in wet sandy and pea soils. Although it has been successfully transplanted and grown in many locales around the world, it is found natively only in North and South Caro- lina in the United States, specifically within a 60 mile radius of Wilmington, Carolina.
