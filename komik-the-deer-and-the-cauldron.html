                                            Read the following text and answert the question.The Sly Mouse Deer    Once there were a mouse deer and a farmer. The farmer planted cucumber in his farm. In the same time, the mouse deer was trying to steal the cucumber. One day, when the mouse deer wanted to steal the cucumber, he saw a scarecrow in the farmer’s field. He was frightened in the first time but soon found that the scarecrow could not scare off him. Even he punched the scarecrow with his front leg. Unluckily his front leg got stuck in the scarecrow because the farmer had filled it with strong adhesive glue.     The mouse deer forcefully tried to pull out his leg, but it did not work. The glue was too strong for him to set free. Not long after that, the farmer came. The farmer was satisfied to his work. The mouse deer was finally trapped. Then the farmer put the mouse deer in a cage.     The mouse deer was really in a big trouble as the farmer’s dog came approaching him. The dog said that the mouse deer would be cut and cooked for the following morning. In such dangerous situation, the mouse deer kept calm even relaxed. Of course it made the dog confused and asked the mouse deer why he was not scared. So the mouse deer answered,” I’ll not be cooked but I’ll be a prince” Hearing the answer, the dog became more confused. Then, the mouse deer continued. “I’m going to marry the farmer’s daughter so I’m going to be a prince. I am sad about you. You have loyalties but they are paid just like this” The mouse deer knew that the dog felt unhappy and continued proudly, “Now, look at me! I’ll become a prince in this house tomorrow”    The dog felt discriminated and asked the mouse deer to switch place. The dog thought that by switching place with the mouse deer in the cage, he would become a prince. The mouse deer agreed. Soon the dog opened the cage and let the mouse deer free. What can we infer from the text above?A. The mouse deer failed to trap the dog.B. The dog was deceived by the mouse deer.C. The mouse deer stayed in the cage at the end.D. The dog would turn to be a prince after staying in the cage. ​</a>

The elephant did not know how to do.In the end, the mouse deer got a bright idea. He said to the elephant, “Come down here! Come down to this hole so you can help me get out!” Foolishly The elephant agreed and followed the mouse deer’s order. The elephant jumped down to the hole.Of course the mouse deer quickly hopped on the elephant’s body and then hopped out of the hole.

The Mouse deer and the crocodile
 The mouse deer was a very tricky animal but he had many enemies. One of his enemies was a crocodile. The crocodile lived in a river near a forest.
 One day, the mouse deer went to the river. It was a very hot day. He wanted something to drink from the river and then he bathed and splashed about in the water.
 Suddenly the crocodile saw the mouse deer. ''Hmm.... a nice meal.'' he thought. Then,he silently crawled behind the mouse deer and grabbed him. He caught the mouse deer's legs.
 The mouse deer was startled and terrified as well. Then, he had an idea. He saw a twig floating near him. He picked it up and sais, 'You stupid fool! So you think you've got me. You've biting a twig-not my leg, you, stupid crocodile! Here's leg.
 And with that, he showed the crocodile the twig. The crocodile could not see very well. He was a very stupid creature, too. He believed the cunning mouse deer. He freed the mouse deer's leg and snapped upon the twig. The mouse deer ran out of the warer immediately.
 ''Ha...ha....ha... , he laughed '' i tricked you!

One day, there was a mouse deer who wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat tasty fruits
and roots and shoots on the other side. However, he could not swim because there was a
crocodile. He did not want the crocodile to eat him first!
The mouse deer had an idea. He called out, "Crocodile!"

The crocodile rose from the water. "Hello, Mouse Deer. Have you come to be my breakfast?"
The mouse deer shook his head. "Not today, Crocodile. I have orders from the king. He
wants me to count all the crocodiles.
"The king!" said the crocodile. "Tell us what to do."
"You must line up from this side of the river to the other side.
The crocodile got all his friends and family. They lined up across the river.
The mouse deer jumped onto crocodile's back. "One." Then, he jumped onto the next
crocodile. "Two." And the next. "Three. The mouse deer kept jumping till he jumped off on the
other side of the river.
"How many are there?" called the crocodile.
"Just enough!" said the mouse deer. "And all silly!"
The mouse deer walked away triumphantly. He got to eat all the tasty foods and saved
himself from the crocodile.

In the same time, the mouse deer was trying to steal the cucumber. One day, when the mouse deer wanted to steal the cucumber, he saw a scarecrow in the farmer’s field. He was frightened in the first time but soon found that the scarecrow could not scare off him. Even he punched the scarecrow with his front leg. Unluckily his front leg got stuck in the scarecrow because the farmer had filled it with strong adhesive glue.     The mouse deer forcefully tried to pull out his leg, but it did not work. The glue was too strong for him to set free. Not long after that, the farmer came. The farmer was satisfied to his work. The mouse deer was finally trapped. Then the farmer put the mouse deer in a cage.     The mouse deer was really in a big trouble as the farmer’s dog came approaching him. The dog said that the mouse deer would be cut and cooked for the following morning. In such dangerous situation, the mouse deer kept calm even relaxed. Of course it made the dog confused and asked the mouse deer why he was not scared. So the mouse deer answered,” I’ll not be cooked but I’ll be a prince” Hearing the answer, the dog became more confused. Then, the mouse deer continued. “I’m going to marry the farmer’s daughter so I’m going to be a prince. I am sad about you. You have loyalties but they are paid just like this” The mouse deer knew that the dog felt unhappy and continued proudly, “Now, look at me! I’ll become a prince in this house tomorrow”    The dog felt discriminated and asked the mouse deer to switch place. The dog thought that by switching place with the mouse deer in the cage, he would become a prince. The mouse deer agreed. Soon the dog opened the cage and let the mouse deer free.

 One day, the mouse deer went to the river. It was a very hot day. He wanted something to drink from the river and then he bathed and splashed about in the water.
 Suddenly the crocodile saw the mouse deer. ''Hmm.... a nice meal.'' he thought. Then,he silently crawled behind the mouse deer and grabbed him. He caught the mouse deer's legs.
 The mouse deer was startled and terrified as well. Then, he had an idea. He saw a twig floating near him. He picked it up and sais, 'You stupid fool! So you think you've got me. You've biting a twig-not my leg, you, stupid crocodile! Here's leg.
 And with that, he showed the crocodile the twig. The crocodile could not see very well. He was a very stupid creature, too. He believed the cunning mouse deer. He freed the mouse deer's leg and snapped upon the twig. The mouse deer ran out of the warer immediately.

and roots and shoots on the other side. However, he could not swim because there was a
crocodile. He did not want the crocodile to eat him first!
The mouse deer had an idea. He called out, "Crocodile!"

The crocodile rose from the water. "Hello, Mouse Deer. Have you come to be my breakfast?"
The mouse deer shook his head. "Not today, Crocodile. I have orders from the king. He
wants me to count all the crocodiles.
"The king!" said the crocodile. "Tell us what to do."
"You must line up from this side of the river to the other side.
The crocodile got all his friends and family. They lined up across the river.
The mouse deer jumped onto crocodile's back. "One." Then, he jumped onto the next
crocodile. "Two." And the next. "Three. The mouse deer kept jumping till he jumped off on the

"How many are there?" called the crocodile.
"Just enough!" said the mouse deer. "And all silly!"
The mouse deer walked away triumphantly. He got to eat all the tasty foods and saved
