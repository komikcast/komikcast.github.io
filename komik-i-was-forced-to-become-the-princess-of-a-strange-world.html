And so, after along time, the prince went back home to his parents and was very sad.One evening there was a terrible storm. It rained heavily and there was thunder and lightning in the sky above the royal castle. Then there was a knock at the castle gate. The old king went out to see who it could be.A princess was standing outside the gate. The rain ran down over her hair and clothes and into her shoes. She told the king that she was a real princess, and he asked her to come inside. “Well, said the old queen. We’ll soon find out if that is true. She went into the guest bedroom and took the mattress and blanket of the bed. Then she put a little green pea on the bed. She put twenty mattress on top of the pea, and then twenty mattress on top of the pea, and then twenty blankets on top of the mattress. This was where the princess was going to spend the night.The next morning the queen asked the princess how she had slept.“oh, it was terrible” answered the princess. Í didn’t close my eyes all night. I don’t know what was in my bed, but I lay on something hard, and now I am black and blue all over. It was quite a terrible night.”Now, the king, the queen and the prince could be sure that this was a real princess she had felt the little pea trough twenty mattresses and twenty blankets. Only a real princess will be able to do that.So the prince married the princess and the pea was put in a museum for everyone to see, unless someone has taken it, it’s still there today.  jawab pertanyaan berikut : a)what is the text about?  b)what did the queen think to prove that the princess?do you agree with that?give your reason.   c)how did the princess fell after she slept on the bed provided?  d)how was the characteristic of a real princess at the time, base on the story?     tolong di jawab yaa :)</a>

                                            The Princess and the Pea
      Once upon a time there was a prince he wanted to get himself a princess, but she had to be real princess. So he traveled all over the world to find one, but in every case something was the matter. There were lots of princess, but he could never quite make out whether they were real or not. So he came home feeling very unhappy, for really wanted to find a true princess.
      One evening a terrible storm came; lightening flashed, thunder rolled, and the rain poured down in torrents-it was simply awful ! suddenly there was a knock at the city gate, and the old king went out to answer it.
      There was a princess standing outside, but what a sight the rain and the bad weather had made of her ! The water streamed down her hair and her clothes, and yet she said she was a real princess.
      “It won’t take long to find that out,” thought the old Queen. Without saying anything, she went into bed chamber, took off all the bedclothes, and places one pea on the bottom boards of the bed. Then she took twenty mattresses and put them on top of the pea, and after that she put twenty feather-pillows on top of the mattresses.
      That was where the princess was to spend the night.
      In the morning they asked her how she had slept.
      “Oh, dreadfully! said the princess. “I hardly slept a wink all night. Whatever could have been in the bed ? I was lying on something so hard that I’m black and blue all over.”
      So of course they could see that she was a real princess, since she had felt the pea through twenty mattresses and twenty feather-pillows. No one but a real princess could have such a tender skin as that.
      So the prince took her for his wife, and they lived happily ever after.

She told the king that she was a real princess, and he asked her to come inside. “Well, said the old queen. We’ll soon find out if that is true. She went into the guest bedroom and took the mattress and blanket of the bed. Then she put a little green pea on the bed. She put twenty mattress on top of the pea, and then twenty mattress on top of the pea, and then twenty blankets on top of the mattress. This was where the princess was going to spend the night.The next morning the queen asked the princess how she had slept.“oh, it was terrible” answered the princess. Í didn’t close my eyes all night. I don’t know what was in my bed, but I lay on something hard, and now I am black and blue all over. It was quite a terrible night.”Now, the king, the queen and the prince could be sure that this was a real princess she had felt the little pea trough twenty mattresses and twenty blankets. Only a real princess will be able to do that.So the prince married the princess and the pea was put in a museum for everyone to see, unless someone has taken it, it’s still there today. pertanyaan:1.

I liked to see some Cleveland Cavaliers basketball matches. Then I went to Hollywood. Hollywood is a famous district in Los Angeles, California, United States. It had become world-famous as the center of the film industry. Four major film companies - Paramount, Warner Bros., RKO and Columbia - had studios in Hollywood. I did not want to leave but I had to. After that, I went to New York City. I visited the Statue of Liberty. I went from the bottom of Manhattan to the top of the crown. That was very amazing. The places made me feel at home but I have to go home. Next time I would return to them.1. what places did the writer visit?2. what kind of place is Hollywood?3. it had become world famous as the center of the film industry.what does the word "it" refer to?4. what film companies are in Hollywood?5. where is the statue of liberty located?​</a>

                            11. The Princess and the Pea
      Once upon a time there was a prince he wanted to get himself a princess, but she had to be real princess. So he traveled all over the world to find one, but in every case something was the matter. There were lots of princess, but he could never quite make out whether they were real or not. So he came home feeling very unhappy, for really wanted to find a true princess.
      One evening a terrible storm came; lightening flashed, thunder rolled, and the rain poured down in torrents-it was simply awful ! suddenly there was a knock at the city gate, and the old king went out to answer it.
      There was a princess standing outside, but what a sight the rain and the bad weather had made of her ! The water streamed down her hair and her clothes, and yet she said she was a real princess.
      “It won’t take long to find that out,” thought the old Queen. Without saying anything, she went into bed chamber, took off all the bedclothes, and places one pea on the bottom boards of the bed. Then she took twenty mattresses and put them on top of the pea, and after that she put twenty feather-pillows on top of the mattresses.
      That was where the princess was to spend the night.
      In the morning they asked her how she had slept.
      “Oh, dreadfully! said the princess. “I hardly slept a wink all night. Whatever could have been in the bed ? I was lying on something so hard that I’m black and blue all over.”
      So of course they could see that she was a real princess, since she had felt the pea through twenty mattresses and twenty feather-pillows. No one but a real princess could have such a tender skin as that.
      So the prince took her for his wife, and they lived happily ever after.
