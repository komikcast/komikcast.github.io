                    <p>¹Mohammad Hatta is my hero because he is an important person in my life. He is almost a perfect person to me. He took us out from the darkness into the light. He is the father of cooperative economic enterprise in Indonesia. He was a political leader. I admire his thoughts about politics and economics, And there are many reasons why I became one of his admirers.Mohammad Hatta was born in West Sumatra in 1902. He comes from an aristocratic family. Mohammad Hatta got the best education available in the Netherlands Indies. Then he continued his studies in economics at the Rotterdam School of Commerce. He joined the Indonesian Independence Movement and edited a journal, &quot;Indonesia Merdeka.&quot; He was arrested in 1927 by the Dutch colonialists. He had a court trial, but he was released. Hatta returned to Sumatra in 1932 and he became the chairman of the Indonesia National Education, a nationalist organization. He was again arrested by the colonialists and exiled in 1935 for his activities.Hatta, Soekarno, and other nationalist leaders decided to cooperate with the Japanese to further the purpose of Indonesian independence. So, on 17th of August 1945, Hatta and Soekarno joined in proclaiming the birth of the independent Republic of Indonesia. Soekarno became the president, and Hatta became the vice president. The Indonesian people were very happy because they got their freedom, but the Dutch colonialists resisted the nationalists. Hatta became premier and defense minister in 1948 to fight against the Dutch troops. Again he was imprisoned by the Dutch in 1948. Then he became a minister again, as before, as vice president of the republic.The communicative purpose of the text is....A. to retell the reader about Moh.

I think I was playing in the garden of the big, old house we lived in. It was in a suburb of London. I can remember starting school when I was five. There was a little boy called Thomas in the same class. He used to pull my hair when the teacher was not looking. One day I hit him on the head with a book and he began to cry. The teacher was very angry with me. I remember him saying, “Little girls don’t do things like that.” But since then Thomas never pulled my hair again.

                                            Ibn Sina was the most famous of the philosopher-scientists of Islam. Ibn Sina, or Avicenna, was born in Bukhara then a leading city in Persia. His youth was spent in the company of the most learned men of his time and he became accomplished in all the sciences and arts. Ibn Sina collected in over 100 books the entire scientific knowledge of his time and is called the "Prince of Science". He spent the last years of his life in Hamadan, where he composed the 'Canon of Medicine', which is among the most famous books in the history of medicine.

                            1. ¹Mohammad Hatta is my hero because he is an important person in my life. He is almost a perfect person to me. He took us out from the darkness into the light. He is the father of cooperative economic enterprise in Indonesia. He was a political leader. I admire his thoughts about politics and economics, And there are many reasons why I became one of his admirers.Mohammad Hatta was born in West Sumatra in 1902. He comes from an aristocratic family. Mohammad Hatta got the best education available in the Netherlands Indies. Then he continued his studies in economics at the Rotterdam School of Commerce. He joined the Indonesian Independence Movement and edited a journal, "Indonesia Merdeka." He was arrested in 1927 by the Dutch colonialists. He had a court trial, but he was released. Hatta returned to Sumatra in 1932 and he became the chairman of the Indonesia National Education, a nationalist organization. He was again arrested by the colonialists and exiled in 1935 for his activities.Hatta, Soekarno, and other nationalist leaders decided to cooperate with the Japanese to further the purpose of Indonesian independence. So, on 17th of August 1945, Hatta and Soekarno joined in proclaiming the birth of the independent Republic of Indonesia. Soekarno became the president, and Hatta became the vice president. The Indonesian people were very happy because they got their freedom, but the Dutch colonialists resisted the nationalists. Hatta became premier and defense minister in 1948 to fight against the Dutch troops. Again he was imprisoned by the Dutch in 1948. Then he became a minister again, as before, as vice president of the republic.The communicative purpose of the text is....A. to retell the reader about Moh.

                        <p>The answer is B</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Kalimat passive (passive voice)</p><p>Passive voice merupakan suatu bentuk kalimat dimana subjek kalimat menerima aksi, bukan melakukan aksi. Tidak seperti active voice yang fokus terhadap pihak yang melakukan aksi (doer of action), bentuk ini lebih berfokus kepada pihak atau objek yang menerima hasil dari suatu aksi tersebut (receiver of action).</p><p>Kalimat aktif yang bisa dirubah menjadi kalimat pasif berbentuk kalimat aktif yang mengandung transitive verbs (kata kerja yang memerlukan objek langsung) seperti make, bring, buy, write dan sebagainya. Sebaliknya, kalimat pasif yang mengandung intransitive verbs (kata kerja yang tidak memerlukan objek langsung) seperti cry, swim, go, arrive, dan die tidak bisa diubah menjadi kalimat pasif. Tetapi, apabila intransitive verbs tersebut diikuti oleh preposition, ada kemungkinan kalimat tersebut bisa diubah menjadi kalimat pasif tetapi kalimat pasif yang terbentuk akan sangat kaku.</p><p>Rumus Kalimat Pasif ( Passive Voice)</p><p>Subject(object dari kalimat aktif) + to be ( disesuaikan dengan bentuk tensesnya + Verb 3 (past participle)</p><p>TENSES                                              RUMUS PASSIVE VOICE</p><p>Simple present                                subject + is/am/are + Verb 3</p><p>Present continuous                     subject + is/am/are + being + Verb 3</p><p>Present perfect                              subject + have/has been + Verb 3</p><p>Simple past                                     subject + was/were + Verb 3</p><p>Past continuous                         subject + was/were + being + Verb 3</p><p>Past perfect                                     subject + had been + Verb 3</p><p>Simple future                                   subject + will be + Verb 3</p><p>Be going to                              subject + is/am/are + going to + be + Verb 3</p><p>Future perfect                                subject + will have been + Verb 3</p><p>Note : Penggunaan kalimat pasif dengan perfect continuous tenses biasanya jarang dilakukan karena akan menghasilkan struktur kalimat yang terlalu rumit dan sulit dipahami. Oleh karena itu, hal ini sebaiknya dihindari meskipun secara tata bahasa benar (grammatically correct).</p><p>Langkah-langkah (tips) membentuk kalimat pasif (Passive Voice) dari kalimat aktif:</p><p>1. Pilih objek penderita dari kalimat aktif itu</p><p>2. Buatlah objek tersebut menjadi subjek dari kalimat pasifnya</p><p>3. Perhatiakan bentuk tensesnya, subjeknya tunggal atau jamak karena tenses yang di gunakan harus sama</p><p>4. bentuklah predikatnya dengan to be + Verb 3</p><p>PELAJARI LEBIH LANJUT</p><p>brainly.co.id/tugas/12128532</p><p>brainly.co.id/tugas/18775915</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>DETAIL JAWABAN:</p><p>Kelas : 8</p><p>Mata Pelajaran: bahasa Inggris</p><p>Bab : 3</p><p>Kode: 8 .5.3</p><p>Kata Kunci : passive voice</p><p></p><br />

I think I was playing in the garden of the big, old house we lived in. It was in a suburb of London. I can remember starting school when I was five. There was a little boy called Thomas in the same class. He used to pull my hair when the teacher was not looking. One day I hit him on the head with a book and he began to cry. The teacher was very angry with me. I remember him saying, “Little girls don’t do things like that.” But since then Thomas never pulled my hair again.
