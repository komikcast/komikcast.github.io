Dear Cyril      I am thankful for everyone at the office for the lovely flowers. They mean a lot for me during my medical treatment. You really give support and positive energy.      I wanted to let you know that I got the result of the final blood test. Day by day, I am getting better and better. The doctor allowed me to return home next three days. I will be phoning Linda to discuss about working from home a couple of days my recovery. As I am feeling strong enough, I will be back to work.      Regards,      Brigitt</a>

                                            internet B a new cat on the Read the following text and then answer the questions. Online Shopping Buying stuff online could be dangerous for us if we didn't do it carefully. As we bought it through the internet, so we could not see or touch the item before it was arrived to our address. My experience was one of the proof that insurance is really important when you wanted to purchase something on the internet. I really wanted to buy a new android phone by using my salary from Google Adsense. So, I decided to try to do it online. I typed on Google the brand of the Android phone that I want and some website or as we called it today "online shop" showed up on the search list. I chose one of the website that I consider to be the most famous of all and then I clicked the link. It brought me to the web page. I saw so many types and series of the brand that I was looking for and I sorted it by its price from the lowest to the highest price. This way, I could chose one that would fit my budget. Finally, I found one. I like the design, color and also the specification, and the price was just as I expected. So I hit the "buy now" button and it brought me to the payment section where I had to choose the payment method that I want. I chose to pay the item through Bank transfer, and the website gave me the total amount that I had to transfer along with the bank account details where I had to transfer the money to. I put all the details on my note and I went to ATM machine to transfer the money. When I got back from the ATM, I took a photo of the transfer receipt and uploaded it to the website as payment proof so that my order could be process right away. After that I had to wait for three days until the item was arrived at my address. When the item was arrived, I opened up the box and took the smartphone out. I tried to turn it on by pressing the power buton several times but nothing happened, and I realized that the phone was broken. Luckily I had the insurance paper stated that i can return the phone and get my money back if the phone was broken. So I sent it back to the company, and got all of my money back.​</a>

                                            Once upon a time there lived a boy with his parents in small village. The parents
were farmers. They taught the boy to be a farmer. But the boy didn't want to be a farmer.
What he did all day was drawing. He love drawing very much but he only drew cat. The
parents became very sad. They thought the boy was not suitable to be a farmer. Finally
they decided to send the boy to the temple to be priest. So the farmer brought the boy to
the priest at the village temple. The priest said, "I will gladly to teach him".
In the temple, the other students worked hard at their writing, but not the boy.
With his brush and rice paper, he did nothing for hours but drawing a cat. Finally the
priest realized that the boy wouldn't be a priest. They asked the boy to go home. On the
way home the boy found a temple. He got in the temple to spend the night there. In the
temple there was a folding screen with empty rice-paper panels, he started to draw a cat.
The cat was very big as big as the wall. At the night the boy entered the small room and
slept there. In the middle of night, he heard the sound of a fight. He didn't dare to come
out. In the morning he just got out from the room when he saw a monster rat as big as a
cow lying dead on the floor. He saw the painting of the cat on the wall. It looked that the
cat was in different position. He also saw blood on the mouth of the cat. Finally he
understood that the cat in the painting became alive and killed the monster. The villagers
were very happy hearing that he claimed the boy as a hero. At last the boy became a
famous painter and his parents were proud of him.

At that lake, I looked for the best point to fish. I went to the place under the big tree at the bank of the lake.
I threw my hook as far as I can then I wait for the fish eating my bait. 30 minutes left and finally there was a fish ate my bait. It was the first big enough fish that I got.
I got 10 big fish and 3 small fish at that day. I was so happy.
I would cook that fish at home and then I would call my friends to come to my home then we would have a small party.
But I was not lucky enough because on the way home I saw a beggar. He was an old poor beggar.
I gave all of my fish to him and I wish he would be happy getting that fish. Perhaps he could sell them at the market and get some money to buy some food.

                                                Buying stuff online could be dangerous for us if we didn’t do it carefully. As we bought it through the internet, so we could not see or touch the item before it was arrived to our address. My experience was one of the proof that insurance is really important when you wanted to purchase something on the internet.      I really wanted to buy a new android phone by using my salary from Google Adsense. So, I decided to try to do it online. I typed on google the brand of the android phone that I want and some website or as we called it today “online shop” showed up on the search list. I chose one of the website that I consider to be the most famous of all and then I clicked the link. It brought me to the web page.      I saw so many types and series of the brand that I was looking for and I sorted it by its price from the lowest to the highest price. This way, I could chose one that would fit my budget. Finally, I found one. I like the design, color and also the specification, and the price was just as I expected. So I hit the “buy now” button and it brought me to the payment section where I had to choose the payment method that I want. I chose to pay the item through Bank transfer, and the website gave me the total amount that I had to transfer along with the bank account details where I had to transfer the money to. I put all the details on my note and I went to ATM machine to transfer the money.      When I got back from the ATM, I took a photo of the transfer receipt and uploaded it to the website as payment proof so that my order could be process right away. After that I had to wait for three days until the item was arrived at my address. When the item was arrived, I opened up the box and took the smartphone out. I tried to turn it on by pressing the power buton several times but nothing happened, and I realized that the phone was broken. Luckily I had the insurance paper stated that I can return the phone and get my money back if the phone was broken. So I sent it back to the company, and got all of my money back.39.

                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Asteroid itu batuan yg mengelilingi matahari yg massanya tidak cukup besar, sehingga tidak dapat mempertahankan bentuk geometri bulat. Makanya bentuk asteroid itu irregular, beda-beda. Nah, ada sebagian asteroid yang massanya cukup besar, dan bentuknya bulat. Contohnya Ceres. Sesuai General Assembly IAU 2006, objek ini dikategorikan sebagai planet kerdil. Jadi asteroid itu pasti BUKAN planet.<br /><br />Dari mana asal asteroid ?<br />-------------------------------------<br />Asalnya dari sisa-sisa nebula protobintang yg membentuk planet-planet. Nah, pada jarak tertentu dari matahari, massa menggumpal dan membentuk benda yg masif karena ada pengaruh gravitasi, maka terbentuklah planet-planet. Sisa dari nebula yg kecil-kecil membentuk ASTEROID. Ada juga asteroid yang terbentuk dari pecahnya planet, yang diyakini sebagai asal usul sabuk asteroid di antara orbit Mars dan Juipter<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />)|(<br />FZA  <br />

                            8. internet B a new cat on the Read the following text and then answer the questions. Online Shopping Buying stuff online could be dangerous for us if we didn't do it carefully. As we bought it through the internet, so we could not see or touch the item before it was arrived to our address. My experience was one of the proof that insurance is really important when you wanted to purchase something on the internet. I really wanted to buy a new android phone by using my salary from Google Adsense. So, I decided to try to do it online. I typed on Google the brand of the Android phone that I want and some website or as we called it today "online shop" showed up on the search list. I chose one of the website that I consider to be the most famous of all and then I clicked the link. It brought me to the web page. I saw so many types and series of the brand that I was looking for and I sorted it by its price from the lowest to the highest price. This way, I could chose one that would fit my budget. Finally, I found one. I like the design, color and also the specification, and the price was just as I expected. So I hit the "buy now" button and it brought me to the payment section where I had to choose the payment method that I want. I chose to pay the item through Bank transfer, and the website gave me the total amount that I had to transfer along with the bank account details where I had to transfer the money to.

                            12. Once upon a time there lived a boy with his parents in small village. The parents
were farmers. They taught the boy to be a farmer. But the boy didn't want to be a farmer.
What he did all day was drawing. He love drawing very much but he only drew cat. The
parents became very sad. They thought the boy was not suitable to be a farmer. Finally
they decided to send the boy to the temple to be priest. So the farmer brought the boy to
the priest at the village temple. The priest said, "I will gladly to teach him".
In the temple, the other students worked hard at their writing, but not the boy.
With his brush and rice paper, he did nothing for hours but drawing a cat. Finally the
priest realized that the boy wouldn't be a priest. They asked the boy to go home. On the
way home the boy found a temple. He got in the temple to spend the night there. In the
temple there was a folding screen with empty rice-paper panels, he started to draw a cat.
The cat was very big as big as the wall. At the night the boy entered the small room and
slept there. In the middle of night, he heard the sound of a fight. He didn't dare to come
out. In the morning he just got out from the room when he saw a monster rat as big as a
cow lying dead on the floor. He saw the painting of the cat on the wall. It looked that the
cat was in different position. He also saw blood on the mouth of the cat. Finally he
understood that the cat in the painting became alive and killed the monster. The villagers
were very happy hearing that he claimed the boy as a hero. At last the boy became a
famous painter and his parents were proud of him.

                            19. Event
At that lake, I looked for the best point to fish. I went to the place under the big tree at the bank of the lake.
I threw my hook as far as I can then I wait for the fish eating my bait. 30 minutes left and finally there was a fish ate my bait. It was the first big enough fish that I got.
I got 10 big fish and 3 small fish at that day. I was so happy.
I would cook that fish at home and then I would call my friends to come to my home then we would have a small party.
But I was not lucky enough because on the way home I saw a beggar. He was an old poor beggar.
I gave all of my fish to him and I wish he would be happy getting that fish. Perhaps he could sell them at the market and get some money to buy some food.

                            21.     Buying stuff online could be dangerous for us if we didn’t do it carefully. As we bought it through the internet, so we could not see or touch the item before it was arrived to our address. My experience was one of the proof that insurance is really important when you wanted to purchase something on the internet.      I really wanted to buy a new android phone by using my salary from Google Adsense. So, I decided to try to do it online. I typed on google the brand of the android phone that I want and some website or as we called it today “online shop” showed up on the search list. I chose one of the website that I consider to be the most famous of all and then I clicked the link. It brought me to the web page.      I saw so many types and series of the brand that I was looking for and I sorted it by its price from the lowest to the highest price. This way, I could chose one that would fit my budget. Finally, I found one. I like the design, color and also the specification, and the price was just as I expected. So I hit the “buy now” button and it brought me to the payment section where I had to choose the payment method that I want. I chose to pay the item through Bank transfer, and the website gave me the total amount that I had to transfer along with the bank account details where I had to transfer the money to. I put all the details on my note and I went to ATM machine to transfer the money.      When I got back from the ATM, I took a photo of the transfer receipt and uploaded it to the website as payment proof so that my order could be process right away. After that I had to wait for three days until the item was arrived at my address. When the item was arrived, I opened up the box and took the smartphone out. I tried to turn it on by pressing the power buton several times but nothing happened, and I realized that the phone was broken. Luckily I had the insurance paper stated that I can return the phone and get my money back if the phone was broken. So I sent it back to the company, and got all of my money back.39.
