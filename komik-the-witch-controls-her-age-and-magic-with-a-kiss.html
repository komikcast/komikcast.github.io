The Good Stepmother
The old witch locked Hansel in a cage and set Gretel to clean the house. She planned to eat them both. Each night the children cried and begged the witch to let them go.
Meanwhile, at home, their stepmother was beginning to wish she had never tried to get rid of the children. “I must find them,” she said and set off into the forest.
Many hours later, when her feet were tired from walking and her lips were dry from thirst, she came to the cottage belonging to the witch. The stepmother peeped though the window. Her heart cried out when she saw the two children.
She picked up the broom leaning against the door and crept inside. The witch was putting some stew in the oven when the stepmother gave her an almighty push. The witch fell into the oven and the stepmother shut the door.
‘Children, I have come to save you,’ she said hugging them tightly. I have done a dreadful thing.
I hope in time you will forgive me. Let me take you home and become a family again. They returned to their home and the stepmother became the best mother anyone could wish to have, and of course they lived happily ever after!

                                            a long time ago, a girl named Rapunzel was known for her beautiful long blonde hair. Unfortunately, she was locked up in a tower with no doors by an evil witch. The witch never allowed her to go out, which made her lonely and miserable. One day, a handsome young prince heard her voice and fell in love with her. Both of them decided to flee, but somehow the witch came to know about it. She cut down Rapunzel’s long beautiful hair and cast a spell on her, which led her to live in a lonely desert. The witch also cast a spell on the prince that made him go blind and left him to wander in the deserted forest.After many years of wandering, the Prince and Rapunzel finally met. Rapunzel was so happy seeing her prince that she started crying, and a few of her tears fell in the prince’s eyes. This brought back his eyesight, and both lived happily ever after in their kingdom.HALOO KA! BOLE TOLONG DIBANTU UNTUK MENCARI STRUKTUR CERITA DI ATAS?

Then he remembered that there was a magic flower in the forest which could cure every illness. But it was guarded by a cruel witch. He went to the forest to pick the magic flower because he really loved his wife and the baby. having arrived in the forest, he saw the flower and picked it. But While he was picking it, the witch saw him and wanted to kill him.”Please don’t kill me”. He begged. “My wife is pregnant and now suffering a strange illness. If I don’t give this magical flower, she and her baby will die”. He added. The witch felt sorry for him and let him go. But she told him if the baby was born, he had to give the baby to her. Because of his worrying, he nodded to agree the condition.Having arrived home, he immediately gave the magic flower to his wife . Then the miracle happened! His wife’s strange illness astonishingly disappeared. She bore a beautiful baby. But suddenly the witch came and robbed the baby and took her away.

Besides her beautiful face, Rapunzel also had a very beautiful voice. She stayed on the top of tower alone. She never saw human except the witch. She felt so lonely that she spent her days by singing.One day, a handsome prince passed the tower. He heard Rapunzel singing beautifully. Then he fell in love with her voice. Every day the prince came to the tower to listen to Rapunzel. Until one day he saw the witch climbed the tower using Rapunzel hair. On the next day, the prince wanted to climb the tower. He was very anxious about her. Then he followed the way the witch called Rapunzel. “Rapunzel, let your hair down”. He imitated the witch. Then Rapunzel let her hair down.

Rapunzel
Long time ago, there's a couple, a man and a wife who live beside a beautiful garden that belonged to a witch. The wife was pregnant. However, she craved some of the rapunzel plant that only grew in the witch’s garden. The husband sneaked over to the garden to collect some of the plant for his wife the next two nights. On the third night, the husband was caught by the witch that was known as “Dame Gothel”. He begs her for mercy, so she agrees to let him take as much Rapunzel as he wishes, in one condition. He must give his child to the witch at her birth. The husband was desperate and agreed to give his child to the witch.
Few months later, the baby was born. It was a girl and named Rapunzel. Soon, she was taken away to the witch. She grew into a beautiful girl with long golden hair. When Rapunzel reached twelve years of age, Dame Gothel locked her in a tower deep in the woods. The tower had no doors and no stairs, but only a simple one room space with a single window. Whenever the witch went into the woods to see Rapunzel, she stood at the base of the tower and said “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, so that I may climb the golden stair”. Rapunzel then would let down her long hair for the witch to climb.
Then one day, a prince went riding through the forest and could hear Rapunzel singing from her tower. Enhanced by her beautiful voice, the Prince found the girl but was unable to get into the tower. After returning often to hear her sing, he saw the witch visiting Rapunzel and learned how to get to her.
Once the witch had gone, the Prince stood at the base of the tower and said “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, so that I may climb the golden stair”. Rapunzel then would let down her long hair for the prince to climb. He climbed and met Rapunzel then he ask her to be his wife. Rapunzel agreed and they planned to escape the tower. Before the plan could take place, Rapunzel accidentally gave away the prince's visits to the witch. In anger, the witch cut off Rapunzel’s long hair and threw her into the forest to fend for herself. When the Prince returned for Rapunzel, he only found the witch in the tower. She told the Prince that he would never be able to see Rapunzel again.
For months, the Prince wandered the country searching for Rapunzel. One day, he heard her voice and they were united once again. The prince brings Rapunzel to the kingdom where the two live happily ever after. </a>

                                            Tolong tentukan generic structure ! Rapunzel Long time ago, there's a couple, a man and a wife who live beside a beautiful garden that belonged to a witch. The wife was pregnant. However, she craved some of the rapunzel plant that only grew in the witch’s garden. The husband sneaked over to the garden to collect some of the plant for his wife the next two nights. On the third night, the husband was caught by the witch that was known as “Dame Gothel”. He begs her for mercy, so she agrees to let him take as much Rapunzel as he wishes, in one condition. He must give his child to the witch at her birth. The husband was desperate and agreed to give his child to the witch. Few months later, the baby was born. It was a girl and named Rapunzel. Soon, she was taken away to the witch. She grew into a beautiful girl with long golden hair. When Rapunzel reached twelve years of age, Dame Gothel locked her in a tower deep in the woods. The tower had no doors and no stairs, but only a simple one room space with a single window. Whenever the witch went into the woods to see Rapunzel, she stood at the base of the tower and said “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, so that I may climb the golden stair”. Rapunzel then would let down her long hair for the witch to climb. Then one day, a prince went riding through the forest and could hear Rapunzel singing from her tower. Enhanced by her beautiful voice, the Prince found the girl but was unable to get into the tower. After returning often to hear her sing, he saw the witch visiting Rapunzel and learned how to get to her. Once the witch had gone, the Prince stood at the base of the tower and said “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, so that I may climb the golden stair”. Rapunzel then would let down her long hair for the prince to climb. He climbed and met Rapunzel then he ask her to be his wife. Rapunzel agreed and they planned to escape the tower. Before the plan could take place, Rapunzel accidentally gave away the prince's visits to the witch. In anger, the witch cut off Rapunzel’s long hair and threw her into the forest to fend for herself. When the Prince returned for Rapunzel, he only found the witch in the tower. She told the Prince that he would never be able to see Rapunzel again. For months, the Prince wandered the country searching for Rapunzel. One day, he heard her voice and they were united once again. The prince brings Rapunzel to the kingdom where the two live happily ever after.</a>

                                            In the Land of the Munchkins Dorothy jumped down from her bed and ran to the door. When she opened it, she gave a cry of surprise. She was not looking at the gray prairie anymore. The house was in a beautiful country that was covered with green grass and tall trees. There were flowers of every color in the grass and the trees were full of delicious fruit. Birds sang and there was a little stream of clear water. "How different this country is from Kansas!" Dorothy cried. "I have never seen such a beautiful place. Where am I? And how did I get here?" At that moment, Dorothy saw some people coming towards her. The people were small, but they were not children. The three men had beards and the woman's hair was white. They were all very strangely dressed. They wore blue hats that were tall and pointed. The men were all dressed in blue, but the little woman was dressed in white. She walked towards Dorothy and bowed. "Welcome to the Land of the Munchkins," the woman said. "Thank you for killing the Wicked Witch of the East. You must be a witch, too. You have killed the Wicked Witch with your magic and now we are free. Thank you." Dorothy was very surprised. She had no magic and she had never killed anyone in her life. "You have made a mistake," Dorothy replied. "I am a girl, not a witch. I have not killed anyone." "Well, then your house killed her. It fell on top of her," said the woman with a laugh. "Look, you can see the legs of the Wicked Witch sticking out from under the house! You can see her Silver Shoes." "Oh, dear," Dorothy said, looking down at the witch's legs and the beautiful Silver Shoes on her feet. "What can I do?" "Nothing," the little woman said. "The Wicked Witch of the East is dead. I am the Good Witch of the North, my dear. I am the Munchkins' friend and now yours, too." Dorothy was very surprised. "I thought that all witches were wicked," she said slowly. "No, that's not true," the Good Witch of the North replied. "There were four witches in the Land of Oz-two were good and two were bad. But now, thanks to you, there is only one wicked witch the Wicked Witch of the West. There is a wizard, too. He is the Great Wizard of Oz and - he lives in the Emerald City." "I am a girl and I live in Kansas with my aunt and uncle," Dorothy replied. "Well, I used to live with them," she went on sadly. "I was carried here by the cyclone and now I want to get back to Kansas. Can you help me?" The Good Witch shook her head. "There is a desert all around the Land of Oz," she said. "No one can cross it. You will have to stay with us, my dear." Dorothy began to cry. "This is a beautiful country," she said. "But Kansas is my home. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em are there and they will be worried about me. Home is always the best place to be. Please, help me to go home." The girl went on crying and the Munchkins began to cry, too because they felt sorry for her. The Good Witch of the North thought for a moment. "You must go to the Emerald City," she said after a while. "The Great Wizard of Oz lives there. Ask him to help you." "How do I get to the Emerald City? Is it a long way? Will you come with me?" Dorothy asked. "You must follow the yellow brick road," the Good Witch replied. "It is a long way. But my kiss will protect you. No one will hurt you when they see this mark." The Good Witch kissed Dorothy and smiled. The kiss had left a strange mark on Dorothy's forehead. "Go to the Great Wizard! You will be safe now," she said.Dorothy stopped crying and thanked the Good Witch. "Look, the Wicked Witch has turned to dust!" one of the Munchkins said to Dorothy "Take her Silver Shoes, my dear! They may help you on your journey. Goodbye." The Munchkins walked away through the trees, talking happily. The Good Witch of the North smiled and walked away, too. Dorothy and Toto were all alone in the Land of Oz.Based on the story, change the direct speech into indirect speech!a. "How different this country is from Kansas!" Dorothy cried.

The Good Stepmother
The old witch locked Hansel in a cage and set Gretel to clean the house. She planned to eat them both. Each night the children cried and begged the witch to let them go.
Meanwhile, at home, their stepmother was beginning to wish she had never tried to get rid of the children. “I must find them,” she said and set off into the forest.
Many hours later, when her feet were tired from walking and her lips were dry from thirst, she came to the cottage belonging to the witch. The stepmother peeped though the window. Her heart cried out when she saw the two children.
She picked up the broom leaning against the door and crept inside. The witch was putting some stew in the oven when the stepmother gave her an almighty push. The witch fell into the oven and the stepmother shut the door.
‘Children, I have come to save you,’ she said hugging them tightly. I have done a dreadful thing.
I hope in time you will forgive me. Let me take you home and become a family again. They returned to their home and the stepmother became the best mother anyone could wish to have, and of course they lived happily ever after!

Even her healthy was getting worse. She could not eat any food. He was so worried both his wife and the baby’s health. Then he remembered that there was a magic flower in the forest which could cure every illness. But it was guarded by a cruel witch. He went to the forest to pick the magic flower because he really loved his wife and the baby. having arrived in the forest, he saw the flower and picked it. But While he was picking it, the witch saw him and wanted to kill him.”Please don’t kill me”. He begged. “My wife is pregnant and now suffering a strange illness. If I don’t give this magical flower, she and her baby will die”. He added. The witch felt sorry for him and let him go. But she told him if the baby was born, he had to give the baby to her. Because of his worrying, he nodded to agree the condition.Having arrived home, he immediately gave the magic flower to his wife . Then the miracle happened! His wife’s strange illness astonishingly disappeared. She bore a beautiful baby. But suddenly the witch came and robbed the baby and took her away. They just saw her leaving without doing anything to prevent it. The witch put the the baby to the very high tower. There was no door. It only had a window. The witch was raising the baby in the tower and gave her name, Rapunzel. Some years later, Rapunzel grew to be a beautiful girl. She has a very long hair. Because it was never cut. The witch used it to climb the tower to give her food. The witch always called her from below. “Rapunzel!! let your hair down! I bring some food for you”. She said.

He climbed to the top of tower with it. After he had reached the top, Rapunzel was so surprised to know that it was not the witch but a handsome prince. Then they fell in love each other. The prince told about everything outside the tower. He invited her to escape. But when they wanted to escape, the witch came and pushed him from the top. It caused him blind.

Rapunzel
Long time ago, there's a couple, a man and a wife who live beside a beautiful garden that belonged to a witch. The wife was pregnant. However, she craved some of the rapunzel plant that only grew in the witch’s garden. The husband sneaked over to the garden to collect some of the plant for his wife the next two nights. On the third night, the husband was caught by the witch that was known as “Dame Gothel”. He begs her for mercy, so she agrees to let him take as much Rapunzel as he wishes, in one condition. He must give his child to the witch at her birth. The husband was desperate and agreed to give his child to the witch.
Few months later, the baby was born. It was a girl and named Rapunzel. Soon, she was taken away to the witch. She grew into a beautiful girl with long golden hair. When Rapunzel reached twelve years of age, Dame Gothel locked her in a tower deep in the woods. The tower had no doors and no stairs, but only a simple one room space with a single window. Whenever the witch went into the woods to see Rapunzel, she stood at the base of the tower and said “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, so that I may climb the golden stair”. Rapunzel then would let down her long hair for the witch to climb.
Then one day, a prince went riding through the forest and could hear Rapunzel singing from her tower. Enhanced by her beautiful voice, the Prince found the girl but was unable to get into the tower. After returning often to hear her sing, he saw the witch visiting Rapunzel and learned how to get to her.
Once the witch had gone, the Prince stood at the base of the tower and said “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, so that I may climb the golden stair”. Rapunzel then would let down her long hair for the prince to climb. He climbed and met Rapunzel then he ask her to be his wife. Rapunzel agreed and they planned to escape the tower. Before the plan could take place, Rapunzel accidentally gave away the prince's visits to the witch. In anger, the witch cut off Rapunzel’s long hair and threw her into the forest to fend for herself. When the Prince returned for Rapunzel, he only found the witch in the tower. She told the Prince that he would never be able to see Rapunzel again.
For months, the Prince wandered the country searching for Rapunzel. One day, he heard her voice and they were united once again. The prince brings Rapunzel to the kingdom where the two live happily ever after. </h2><br />

                            26. Tolong tentukan generic structure ! Rapunzel Long time ago, there's a couple, a man and a wife who live beside a beautiful garden that belonged to a witch. The wife was pregnant. However, she craved some of the rapunzel plant that only grew in the witch’s garden. The husband sneaked over to the garden to collect some of the plant for his wife the next two nights. On the third night, the husband was caught by the witch that was known as “Dame Gothel”. He begs her for mercy, so she agrees to let him take as much Rapunzel as he wishes, in one condition. He must give his child to the witch at her birth. The husband was desperate and agreed to give his child to the witch. Few months later, the baby was born. It was a girl and named Rapunzel. Soon, she was taken away to the witch. She grew into a beautiful girl with long golden hair. When Rapunzel reached twelve years of age, Dame Gothel locked her in a tower deep in the woods. The tower had no doors and no stairs, but only a simple one room space with a single window. Whenever the witch went into the woods to see Rapunzel, she stood at the base of the tower and said “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, so that I may climb the golden stair”. Rapunzel then would let down her long hair for the witch to climb. Then one day, a prince went riding through the forest and could hear Rapunzel singing from her tower. Enhanced by her beautiful voice, the Prince found the girl but was unable to get into the tower. After returning often to hear her sing, he saw the witch visiting Rapunzel and learned how to get to her. Once the witch had gone, the Prince stood at the base of the tower and said “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, so that I may climb the golden stair”. Rapunzel then would let down her long hair for the prince to climb. He climbed and met Rapunzel then he ask her to be his wife. Rapunzel agreed and they planned to escape the tower. Before the plan could take place, Rapunzel accidentally gave away the prince's visits to the witch. In anger, the witch cut off Rapunzel’s long hair and threw her into the forest to fend for herself. When the Prince returned for Rapunzel, he only found the witch in the tower. She told the Prince that he would never be able to see Rapunzel again. For months, the Prince wandered the country searching for Rapunzel. One day, he heard her voice and they were united once again. The prince brings Rapunzel to the kingdom where the two live happily ever after.</h2><br />

He was so worried both his wife and the baby’s health.Then he remembered that there was amagic flower in the forest which could cure every illness. But it was guarded by a cruel witch. He went to the forest to pick the magic flower because he really loved his wife and the baby. having arrived in the forest, he saw theflower and picked it. But While he was picking it, the witch saw him and wanted to kill him.”Please don’t kill me”. He begged. “My wife is pregnant and now suffering a strange illness. If I don’t give this magical flower, she and her baby will die”. He added. The witchfelt sorry for him and let him go. But she told him if the baby was born, he had to give the baby to her. Because ofhis worrying, he nodded to agree the condition.Having arrived home, he immediately gave the magic flower to his wife . Then the miracle happened! His wife’s strange illness astonishingly disappeared. She bore a beautiful baby. But suddenly the witch came androbbed the baby and took her away. They just saw her leaving without doing anything to prevent it.The witch put the the baby to the very high tower. There was no door. It only had a window. The witch was raising the baby in the tower and gave her name, Rapunzel. Some years later, Rapunzel grew to be a beautiful girl. She has a very long hair. Because it was never cut. The witch used it to climb the tower to give her food. The witch always called her from below. “Rapunzel!! let your hair down! I bring some food for you”. She said. Besides her beautiful face, Rapunzel also had avery beautiful voice. She stayed on the top of tower alone. She never saw human except the witch. She felt so lonely that she spent her days by singing.One day, a handsome prince passed the tower. He heard Rapunzel singing beautifully. Then he fell in love with her voice. Every day the prince came to the tower to listen to Rapunzel. Untilone day he saw the witch climbed the tower using Rapunzel hair. On the nextday, the prince wanted to climb the tower. He was very anxious about her. Then he followed the way the witch called Rapunzel. “Rapunzel, let your hair down”. He imitated the witch. Then Rapunzel let her hair down. He climbed to the top of tower with it. After he had reached the top, Rapunzelwas so surprised to know that it was not the witch but a handsome prince. Then they fell in love each other. The prince told about everything outside the tower. He invited her to escape. But when they wanted to escape, the witch came and pushed him from the top. It caused him blind.

                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="in-the-land-of-the-munchkins-dorothy-jumped-down-from-her-bed-and-ran-to-the-door-when-she-opened-it-she-gave-a-cry-of-surprise-she-was-not-looking-at-the-gray-prairie-anymore-the-house-was-in-a-b">
                            40. In the Land of the Munchkins Dorothy jumped down from her bed and ran to the door. When she opened it, she gave a cry of surprise. She was not looking at the gray prairie anymore. The house was in a beautiful country that was covered with green grass and tall trees. There were flowers of every color in the grass and the trees were full of delicious fruit. Birds sang and there was a little stream of clear water. "How different this country is from Kansas!" Dorothy cried. "I have never seen such a beautiful place. Where am I? And how did I get here?" At that moment, Dorothy saw some people coming towards her. The people were small, but they were not children. The three men had beards and the woman's hair was white. They were all very strangely dressed. They wore blue hats that were tall and pointed. The men were all dressed in blue, but the little woman was dressed in white. She walked towards Dorothy and bowed. "Welcome to the Land of the Munchkins," the woman said. "Thank you for killing the Wicked Witch of the East. You must be a witch, too. You have killed the Wicked Witch with your magic and now we are free. Thank you." Dorothy was very surprised. She had no magic and she had never killed anyone in her life. "You have made a mistake," Dorothy replied. "I am a girl, not a witch. I have not killed anyone." "Well, then your house killed her. It fell on top of her," said the woman with a laugh. "Look, you can see the legs of the Wicked Witch sticking out from under the house! You can see her Silver Shoes." "Oh, dear," Dorothy said, looking down at the witch's legs and the beautiful Silver Shoes on her feet. "What can I do?" "Nothing," the little woman said. "The Wicked Witch of the East is dead. I am the Good Witch of the North, my dear. I am the Munchkins' friend and now yours, too." Dorothy was very surprised. "I thought that all witches were wicked," she said slowly. "No, that's not true," the Good Witch of the North replied. "There were four witches in the Land of Oz-two were good and two were bad. But now, thanks to you, there is only one wicked witch the Wicked Witch of the West. There is a wizard, too. He is the Great Wizard of Oz and - he lives in the Emerald City." "I am a girl and I live in Kansas with my aunt and uncle," Dorothy replied. "Well, I used to live with them," she went on sadly. "I was carried here by the cyclone and now I want to get back to Kansas. Can you help me?" The Good Witch shook her head. "There is a desert all around the Land of Oz," she said. "No one can cross it. You will have to stay with us, my dear." Dorothy began to cry. "This is a beautiful country," she said. "But Kansas is my home. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em are there and they will be worried about me. Home is always the best place to be. Please, help me to go home." The girl went on crying and the Munchkins began to cry, too because they felt sorry for her. The Good Witch of the North thought for a moment. "You must go to the Emerald City," she said after a while. "The Great Wizard of Oz lives there. Ask him to help you." "How do I get to the Emerald City? Is it a long way? Will you come with me?" Dorothy asked. "You must follow the yellow brick road," the Good Witch replied. "It is a long way. But my kiss will protect you. No one will hurt you when they see this mark." The Good Witch kissed Dorothy and smiled. The kiss had left a strange mark on Dorothy's forehead. "Go to the Great Wizard! You will be safe now," she said.Dorothy stopped crying and thanked the Good Witch. "Look, the Wicked Witch has turned to dust!" one of the Munchkins said to Dorothy "Take her Silver Shoes, my dear! They may help you on your journey. Goodbye." The Munchkins walked away through the trees, talking happily. The Good Witch of the North smiled and walked away, too. Dorothy and Toto were all alone in the Land of Oz.Based on the story, change the direct speech into indirect speech!a. "How different this country is from Kansas!" Dorothy cried.
