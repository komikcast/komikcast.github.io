First of all I love Agnes Monica. She is my inspiration and role model and one of my dreams is to meet her. I’m from Kalimantan and I hope someday she comes to Kalimantan. Well, Agnes is my idol and I think she is such a great role model, she is awesome! I love how she changes in some ways but never forgets who she is, she never forgets the essence of her sparkle.
Agnes has taught me many things such us to be fearless, to always fight for your dreams no matter what, to know that if I’m different that’s a good thing and I don’t have to change that, to be myself, to never give up on my dreams, to speak now, and many other things. Agnes Monica is the best.</a>

First of all I love Agnes Monica. She is my inspiration and role model and one of my dreams is to meet her. I’m from Kalimantan and I hope someday she comes to Kalimantan. Well, Agnes is my idol and I think she is such a great role model, she is awesome! I love how she changes in some ways but never forgets who she is, she never forgets the essence of her sparkle.
Agnes has taught me many things such us to be fearless, to always fight for your dreams no matter what, to know that if I’m different that’s a good thing and I don’t have to change that, to be myself, to never give up on my dreams, to speak now, and many other things. Agnes Monica is the best.</h2><br />

Saya menyukai bagaimana tampilannya dalam beberapa cara tapi tidak pernah melupakan siapa dia, dia tidak pernah lupa dengan esensi dari kilauannya.<br />Agnes mengajari saya banyak hal seperti kita harus menjadi pemberani, selalu berjuang untuk impian mu apapun itu, mengetahui bahwa jika saya berbeda itu adalah hal yang baik dan saya tidak harus merubahnya, menjadi diri sendiri, tidak pernah menyerah dalam mimpi saya, untuk berbicara, dan banyak hal lain. Agnes Monica adalah yang terbaik.Pertama-tama aku sangat cinta pada Agnes Monica. Dia adalah inspirasiku dan panutan dan salah satu impainku adalah bertemu dengannya. Aku dari Kalimantan dan aku berharap suatu hari dia datang ke Kalimantan. Ya, Agnes adalah idolaku dan menurutku dia adalah panutan yang sangat hebat. Aku suka ketika dia berubah dengan berbagai cara tapi tidak lupa dirinya yang sebenarnya  dia tidak pernah lupa inti dari kilauannya.<br /><br />Agnes telah mengajarkan aku banyak hal seperti untuk tidak takut, untuk meraih mimpimu, tahu bahwa berbeda adalah hal yang baik dan aku tidak perlu merubah itu untuk menjadi diriku sendiri, pantang menyerah meraih mimpi, untuk berbicara sekarang, dan hal lainnya. Agnes Monica yang terbaik.<br /><br />Maaf kalau ada yang salah<br />
