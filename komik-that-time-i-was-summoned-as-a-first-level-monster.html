                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>cerita cinderella </p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p><strong>Once upon a time</strong>, Cinderella lived with her mother and father. Sadly, her mother was died and her father got remarried. Her stepmother had two daughters, so Cinderella had two step sisters. They were so nice to her and Cinderella was so happy about that.
</p><p>
</p><p>One day, her father had to go to out of town for working. Cinderella was left at home with her stepmother and step sisters. They acted differently towards her. They were so cruel and asked Cinderella to be their maid. She was so sad about <strong>that.</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>After </strong>few days, Cinderella got bad news that her father was died in accident while working. Her stepmother and step sisters treated Cinderella even worse. She was not allowed to have a good meal , dresses, shoes, and stuff, and proper room and bed for her.
</p><p>
</p><p>On the other side, there was a King that looking for a wife for her son. Therefore, he held a party and invited all the girls. Cinderella wanted to come to the party, but her stepmother and step sisters definitely forbade her to come. She was so sad looking her stepmother and step sisters went there beautifully.
</p><p>
</p><p>A fairy felt so sorry about her and helped her by giving her beautiful dress, shoes, and train to go there. She went there and met the Prince. They danced all along the night. Unfortunately, she had to be back at home before 12 or she turned into the way she before. They were separated, but Cinderella accidentally left her shoe, because she was in hurry.
</p><p>
</p><p>Next day, the Kingdom especially the Prince looked for the owner of the shoe. All girls tried to wear that shoe, but no one seemed to be the owner. Cinderella appeared and tried the shoe. She was the owner of the shoe, so the shoe fitted on her. The Prince was so happy that he<strong> finally</strong> met her. Cinderella and the Prince got married and lived happily ever after.</p><br />
