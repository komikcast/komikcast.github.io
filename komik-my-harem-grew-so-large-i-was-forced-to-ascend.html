                                            This happened while I was in the high school of the 12th grade. We were in the same class worked together to cleaned and tidy up a flower garden in front of our class. I was at the garden in front of my class and planted flowers with my best friend Diah. After we were planted the flowers, Diah asked me to get water. Then I went to get water. I was so happy when I was on my way back, I did not even notice the slippery floors. I felled to the floor and the water I carried dammed me in half. It was so painful! Several student were surprised when I fell to the floor and giggled. I was embarrased, of course. But the pain was all over my body. I just walked slowly to the class then. 	When I got to the front of the class, my friend asked me why I looked wet and in pain. I was actually embarassed to tell them what happened, but they were so curious and forced me. So, I told them. Some of my friend were laughing about it. Because of that, my best friend Diah asked me to change my wet clothes. 	We went back to class and we saw our friend decorating. We also helped out and did decorations with colorful ribbons. After that, we were going to hanged the ribbon decoration over the ceiling, they were asked me to hanged the ribbon because I was one of the tall students who were able to reach the ceiling by climbing up the desks and chairs arranged to form the cords over the ceiling. I said yes, when I was done hanged up the ribbon, I asked my friend downstairs to push the table that I was on, so that I cloud hang up the other ribbon. It turns out that the table broke and I am falled from above then feel really surprised, emberassed and in pain at the same time. So, my friend helped me to get up. Of course, my all friend in the class that surprised. I ran out of the classroom and hid in a mosque for a while. So that, I feel ashamed twice in one day.  It is sad and emberrased when some people laugh at me, but it is nice to have friends by my side. Okay, that is all my embarassing happened in one day. bisakah kalian melihat mana kalimat yang salah, yang sebenarnya plural tapi tertulis singular?</a>

So he could not take me to school.I dare to go to school alone by riding a bicycle. I leave at 11.00. I swing my bicycle and I pass the road that I never passed, but the road is the only way that is safe to pass without the presence of a large vehicle. Suddenly in the middle of the road, I was really confused I had to go through which road. I want to ask someone but no one passes that way.I can only swing my bike without direction with a sad face. Then I stopped, because the more I swung my bike the more I got lost on the road that didn't know the direction. then I pray for help.suddenly I saw a friend of mine who was passing by going to school.

                                            Last week I got stomachache. My mother brought me to the hospital. The doctor asked me what I had eaten. Then I told him that I ate so many spicy foods. He suggested me reduce consuming spicy food. I didn’t like his suggestion, but my mother forced me. I must consume healthy foods, so that I won’t get stomachace anymore 3.

I graduated from middle school about two years ago and I am currently attending a high school in my city. I am a junior and I am interested in social science, especially economics. I also have a guitar course. My life is really busy, but I enjoy listening to the music, reading, hiking and hanging out with my friends in my free time. I like playing skateboard as well. I always go skateboarding in the park next to the museum. When I graduate, I want to work for a company in this city. What sport is Sebastian likes to do in his free time? * 5 poin listening to the music jogging camping hiking Read the following text, then, answer</a>

                                            I experienced this when my family and I visited Bandung last holiday. Oneafternoon, we visited Jalan Dago which is very famous for shoppers. There aremany shops selling their products at affordable prices. We entered a largeconvenient store. Mother and I went to the ladies stands, while my father andbrother proceeded to the gents stands.I was so excited that I didn't realize I was separated from my family. I wasso worried. I tried to call them one by one, but no one heard me. Finally, I decidedto go back to the car. It was parked not far from the store. I immediately opened thedoor and sat on the back seat. But how shocked I'was when a woman who greeted"Hello, who are you?” When I looked at her, I did not know her. I was sitting inthe wrong car! I jumped out of the car and ran to the store.

I went there with my friends.Arriving at the lake, I directly went to the best spot to get a giant fish. It was under the big tree at the bank of the lake. I threw my hook as far as I could then I waited for the fish eating my bait. It had been 15 minutes and I finally saw the sign that there was a fish eating my bait. I tried to pull it up and I succeeded. I got a three kilogram fish.I got so many fish that day even though I was so tired. I was so excited. I think I will visit the spot again in the next holiday.a. greatb. largec. very bigd. huge​</a>

                                            One day when I was 4 years old, this accident happened when the chronology began when my sister, who was still in school, was going to be delivered by my father to school and I wanted to take part too, initially the trip all went smoothly but when we passed the road was flooded by water, we did not know if the road had enough damage so that with my father driving quite fast, the damaged road was hit and our motorbike crashed and I bounced forward and dragged the sidewalk far enough and caused a wound badly on my head, but my father and sister did not experience serious injuries then I was immediately helped by public transport passengers and then I was taken to the nearest hospital but when I went to the hospital I could not handle it so I was taken back to the hospital which was quite large, then there I was X-rayed and said dok there are quite deep cracks and are recommended for surgery but after being seen further it turned out that the operation was not a problem and I experienced many problems around my head and every week I had to control it regularly until the wound healed was a pretty dark experience for me(maaf kak tolong refisiin lagi ya soalnya ini translet cerita saya sendiri hehe)​</a>

                            6. This happened while I was in the high school of the 12th grade. We were in the same class worked together to cleaned and tidy up a flower garden in front of our class. I was at the garden in front of my class and planted flowers with my best friend Diah. After we were planted the flowers, Diah asked me to get water. Then I went to get water. I was so happy when I was on my way back, I did not even notice the slippery floors. I felled to the floor and the water I carried dammed me in half. It was so painful! Several student were surprised when I fell to the floor and giggled. I was embarrased, of course. But the pain was all over my body. I just walked slowly to the class then. 	When I got to the front of the class, my friend asked me why I looked wet and in pain. I was actually embarassed to tell them what happened, but they were so curious and forced me. So, I told them. Some of my friend were laughing about it. Because of that, my best friend Diah asked me to change my wet clothes. 	We went back to class and we saw our friend decorating. We also helped out and did decorations with colorful ribbons. After that, we were going to hanged the ribbon decoration over the ceiling, they were asked me to hanged the ribbon because I was one of the tall students who were able to reach the ceiling by climbing up the desks and chairs arranged to form the cords over the ceiling. I said yes, when I was done hanged up the ribbon, I asked my friend downstairs to push the table that I was on, so that I cloud hang up the other ribbon. It turns out that the table broke and I am falled from above then feel really surprised, emberassed and in pain at the same time. So, my friend helped me to get up. Of course, my all friend in the class that surprised. I ran out of the classroom and hid in a mosque for a while. So that, I feel ashamed twice in one day.  It is sad and emberrased when some people laugh at me, but it is nice to have friends by my side. Okay, that is all my embarassing happened in one day. bisakah kalian melihat mana kalimat yang salah, yang sebenarnya plural tapi tertulis singular?</h2><br />
