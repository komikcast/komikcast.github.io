It is unusual incident, isn't? One morning, a man was crossing a narrow bridge. When he saw a fisherman under him on the shady bank of the deep smooth river, he stopped to watch him quietly. He saw that the fisherman took off the hook and caught a big fish. But he threw it back to water. Then he put his hook and line in again. After a minute he caught rather big fish. Again, he threw it back into the river. Then the third time, he caught a small fish. He put it into his basket and started to get ready to go. The man on the bridge was very surprised, so he spoke to the fisherman. He asked why did he threw those beautiful big fishes back into the water and just kept only the small one. The fisherman looked up and answered, "I only have a small frying pan." Poor fisherman!</a>

                        <p>Answer:</p><br /><p>Passive sentence is a form of sentence which focuses on object, so it starts with an object at the beginning of the sentence instead of using subject. The pattern is : O + auxiliary verb + V3 + by + S</p><p>The sentence above is past tense so the past passive of it is </p><p>O + was/were + V3 + by + S</p><p>The answer of such exercise is </p><p>'That pie wasn't made by me.

It is unusual incident, isn't? One morning, a man was crossing a narrow bridge. When he saw a fisherman under him on the shady bank of the deep smooth river, he stopped to watch him quietly. He saw that the fisherman took off the hook and caught a big fish. But he threw it back to water. Then he put his hook and line in again. After a minute he caught rather big fish. Again, he threw it back into the river. Then the third time, he caught a small fish. He put it into his basket and started to get ready to go. The man on the bridge was very surprised, so he spoke to the fisherman. He asked why did he threw those beautiful big fishes back into the water and just kept only the small one. The fisherman looked up and answered, "I only have a small frying pan." Poor fisherman!</h2><br />
