She doesn't like to help her mother work in a field. The girl is very lazy. One day, the mother asks the girl to accompany her to go to the market to buy some food. At first the girl refuses, but the mother persuades her by saying they are going to buy new clothes. The girl finally agrees. But she asks her mother to walk behind her. She doesn't want to walk side by side with her mother. Although her mother is very sad, she agrees to walk behind her daughter. On the way to the market, everybody admires the girl's beauty. They are also curious. Behind the beautiful girl, there is an old woman with a simple dress. The girl and her mother look very different! "Hello, pretty lady. Who is the woman behind you?" asks them. "She is my servant," answers the girl. The mother is very sad, but she doesn't say anything. The girl and the mother meet other people. "Hello, beauty. Who is the woman behind you?" asks them again. Again the girl answers that her mother is her servant. She always says that her mother is her servant every time they meet people. At last, the mother cannot hold the pain anymore. She prays to God to punish her daughter. God answers her prayer. Slowly, the girl's leg turns into stone. The process continues to the upper part of the girl's body. The girl is very panicky. "Mother, please forgive me!" she cries and ask her mother to forgive her. But it's too late. Her whole body finally becomes a big stone. Until now people still can see tears falling down the stone. People then call it the crying stone or in Indonesian mean batu menangis. 1. What is the main idea of the story? 2. Who are the characters in the story? 3. What was the character of the daughter? 4.

The daughter was really a beautiful girl, but she had a bad character. She was arrogant, lazy girl. She never helped her mother to do some house work. She always admired her beauty every day. The girl was also a spoiled girl, when she wanted something, his mother had to make it. The girl’s mother was really pity. She had to work day and night, but the girl was doing nothing.         One day, the girl and her mother went out. They wanted to buy something in the market. The location of the market was really far from home, so they had to walk miles away. The girl was walking in front of her mother. She wore a beautiful dress. Meanwhile, her mother was walking behind the girl. The mother’s dress was dirty and ugly. She brought an umbrella. No one expected that the two people who walked was a mother and her daughter. When they entered the village, the villagers saw the girl and admired her. They’re so amazed with the girl’s beauty, but, when they saw the woman who walked behind the girl they wondered. Who was the old woman? One of the villagers asked to the girl. “Hey, beautiful girl. Is that your mother who walks behind you?” asked one of the villagers. The girl arrogantly said, “Of course no, she is my maid,” said the girl. They continued the journey. And then, a young man met them and asked a question. “Hey sweety, is that your mother who walks behind you?” asked the young man. “No… of course no, can’t you see that? She’s really different with me. How could you say that she is my mother? She is my slave,” replied the girl. Every time they walked, the girl said that the woman walked behind her was her maid/her slave. She never admitted that the woman is her mother. The mother was really disappointed with her daughter. She couldn’t bear it. The girl’s saying hurt her heart. The poor mother finally prayed to God. “Oh God, I can’t stand this. My daughter always humiliates me. I am so disappointed with her. Please give her punishment, God, please…” prayed the mother.            With the Power of God, suddenly the girl’s body turned into a stone little by little. The changes of the body started from the leg and the other parts of the body. The girl cried and asked for a help to her mother. “Please forgive me mother…forgive my attitude…please mother…please help me,” cried the girl, but it was too late.​</a>

                                            Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl named Cinderella. She lived with
her wicked stepmother and stepsisters who treated her badly. One day, the
prince held a grand ball, and Cinderella desperately wanted to attend. With
the help of her fairy godmother, she got a beautiful dress and glass slippers to
wear to the ball. At the ball, the prince fell in love with her, but Cinderella had
to leave before midnight when the spell would be broken. The prince
searched for Cinderella, and when he found her, they lived happily ever after.

                            18. Teks 1 In a small village, a girl lives with her mother. The girl is very beautiful. Everyday she puts make-up and wears her best clothes. She doesn't like to help her mother work in a field. The girl is very lazy. One day, the mother asks the girl to accompany her to go to the market to buy some food. At first the girl refuses, but the mother persuades her by saying they are going to buy new clothes. The girl finally agrees. But she asks her mother to walk behind her. She doesn't want to walk side by side with her mother. Although her mother is very sad, she agrees to walk behind her daughter. On the way to the market, everybody admires the girl's beauty. They are also curious. Behind the beautiful girl, there is an old woman with a simple dress. The girl and her mother look very different! "Hello, pretty lady. Who is the woman behind you?" asks them. "She is my servant," answers the girl. The mother is very sad, but she doesn't say anything. The girl and the mother meet other people. "Hello, beauty. Who is the woman behind you?" asks them again. Again the girl answers that her mother is her servant. She always says that her mother is her servant every time they meet people. At last, the mother cannot hold the pain anymore. She prays to God to punish her daughter. God answers her prayer. Slowly, the girl's leg turns into stone. The process continues to the upper part of the girl's body. The girl is very panicky. "Mother, please forgive me!" she cries and ask her mother to forgive her. But it's too late. Her whole body finally becomes a big stone. Until now people still can see tears falling down the stone. People then call it the crying stone or in Indonesian mean batu menangis. 1. What is the main idea of the story? 2. Who are the characters in the story? 3. What was the character of the daughter? 4.

The daughter was really a beautiful girl, but she had a bad character. She was arrogant, lazy girl. She never helped her mother to do some house work. She always admired her beauty every day. The girl was also a spoiled girl, when she wanted something, his mother had to make it. The girl’s mother was really pity. She had to work day and night, but the girl was doing nothing.         One day, the girl and her mother went out. They wanted to buy something in the market. The location of the market was really far from home, so they had to walk miles away. The girl was walking in front of her mother. She wore a beautiful dress. Meanwhile, her mother was walking behind the girl. The mother’s dress was dirty and ugly. She brought an umbrella. No one expected that the two people who walked was a mother and her daughter. When they entered the village, the villagers saw the girl and admired her. They’re so amazed with the girl’s beauty, but, when they saw the woman who walked behind the girl they wondered. Who was the old woman? One of the villagers asked to the girl. “Hey, beautiful girl. Is that your mother who walks behind you?” asked one of the villagers. The girl arrogantly said, “Of course no, she is my maid,” said the girl. They continued the journey. And then, a young man met them and asked a question. “Hey sweety, is that your mother who walks behind you?” asked the young man. “No… of course no, can’t you see that? She’s really different with me. How could you say that she is my mother? She is my slave,” replied the girl. Every time they walked, the girl said that the woman walked behind her was her maid/her slave. She never admitted that the woman is her mother. The mother was really disappointed with her daughter. She couldn’t bear it. The girl’s saying hurt her heart. The poor mother finally prayed to God. “Oh God, I can’t stand this. My daughter always humiliates me. I am so disappointed with her. Please give her punishment, God, please…” prayed the mother.            With the Power of God, suddenly the girl’s body turned into a stone little by little. The changes of the body started from the leg and the other parts of the body. The girl cried and asked for a help to her mother. “Please forgive me mother…forgive my attitude…please mother…please help me,” cried the girl, but it was too late.​</h2><br />
