proud of it. Then, he ran off until he reached the bank of the river. He looked
down into the river water carefully and he saw another dog with a piece of meat
in its mouth.       Funnily enough, the dog did not realize that it was his own
reflection  in the water. When he was
full, he threw himself on the other dog to steal his meat as well.
Unfortunately, when he was in the water, he had to let go the remains of the
meat to avoid drowning, and so was left with nothing.</a>

Kartini, it's not an easy matter to draw Kartini's beautiful face, but I have to draw it well in order to win the competition, at that time I didn't win the competition because it was my first drawing competition and my opponent was a different class sister from 1 to 3 years from my age, I drew the face of Kartini's mother carefully to look similar and beautiful, I was very careful in detail in all parts, I was the first person to collect the images to the jury of the race. When announcing the race, I was very scared and nervous, but all my hard work paid off I got the first place in the drawing competition, I was very grateful because without God's help it would not have happened. When I went up to grade 6 I went back to the drawing competition this time we were drawing a traditional house from Padang, I was very worried because I could not draw a house well enough to draw a traditional house, but all that fear was far far from my heart I was drawing a house The custom was good and finally I got the 1st place in the drawing competition for the 2nd participation and I was very happy.​</a>

Semua hadiah dibungkus dengan kertas berwarna. Beberapa paketnya besar, tetapi yang lain sangat kecil. Ada yang berat dan ada yang ringan. Satu paket persegi berwarna merah, ada kaus baru di dalamnya. Satu lagi panjang dan sempit;  ada payung di dalamnya. Kakak Ragil memberinya hadiah besar, yaitu sebuah paket bulat. Dia pikir itu bola tapi ternyata bukan. Ketika dia melepaskan kertas biru yang menutupinya, dia melihat bahwa itu adalah bola dunia. Setelah itu saudaranya memberi Ragil hadiah lain. Itu adalah kotak besar yang dibungkus kertas kuning. Ragil membuka itu dan menemukan kotak lain ditutupi dengan kertas ungu. Dia mengeluarkan kertas itu dan melihat kotak ketiga, yang ini berwarna hijau. Semua orang tertawa saat Ragil membuka kotak itu. Ada tujuh dari mereka. Terakhir salah satunya ia menemukan sebuah amplop putih kecil. Ada secarik kertas di dalam amplop yang bertuliskan "Pergi ke ruangan besar. Lihat di dekat jendela tinggi. Anda akan melihat lima koper, satu putih, satu oranye, satu merah muda, satu hitam dan satu coklat. Hadiah ulang tahunmu ada di salah satunya. Ragil masuk ke ruangan besar itu.

                            21.   Tolong bantu jawab ceritanya ada di bawah klo jawabnya cuma di terjemahkan doang saya juga bisaa..One day, a dog stole a big piece of meat and he was very proud of it. Then, he ran off until he reached the bank of the river. He looked down into the river water carefully and he saw another dog with a piece of meat in its mouth. Funnily enough, the dog did not realise that it was his own reflection in the water. When he was full, he threw himself on the other dog to steal his meat as well. Unfortunately, when he was in the water, he had to let go the remains of the meal to avoid drowning, and so was left with nothing. Questions: 1. What did the dog do in the bank of the river?2. What was the other dog in the river? 3.Did the dog realise it? 4. What is meant by "when he was full"? 5. What is meant by "so was left with nothing"?​</h2><br />

Kartini, it's not an easy matter to draw Kartini's beautiful face, but I have to draw it well in order to win the competition, at that time I didn't win the competition because it was my first drawing competition and my opponent was a different class sister from 1 to 3 years from my age, I drew the face of Kartini's mother carefully to look similar and beautiful, I was very careful in detail in all parts, I was the first person to collect the images to the jury of the race. When announcing the race, I was very scared and nervous, but all my hard work paid off I got the first place in the drawing competition, I was very grateful because without God's help it would not have happened.
