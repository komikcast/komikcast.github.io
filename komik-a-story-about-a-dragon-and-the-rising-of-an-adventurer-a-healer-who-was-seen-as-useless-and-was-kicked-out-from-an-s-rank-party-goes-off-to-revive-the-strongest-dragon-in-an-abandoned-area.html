                                            George and the DragonOnce upon a time there was a brave knight called George. George had lots of adventures as he travelled by horse across many lands.One day he cam to a small village and met a man who lived in a cave next to the village. The hermit told the knight about the awful things that were happening there. A terrible dragon had come to live in the lake and attacked the village every day.The villagers didn't know what to do. First, they gave the dragon all their food, but the dragon just took the food and still attacked the village. So then the villagers gave the dragon all the animals from their farms. The dragon took all the animals, but continued to attack the villagers. So then they gave the dragon all their gold and jewels. The dragon took all their money, but still was not satisfied.The king sent his army to try and capture the dragon, but the dragon was too strong and the knights of the army were too scared and they ran away. With nothing left to give, the king could only think of one thing to help protect his people. He sent his only daughter, the princess, to the lake to wait for the dragon. The princess was scared, but she tried to calm down.When George heard this he rode as fast as he could to the lake. Just then the dragon jumped out from the lake and was going to eat the princess. George attacked the dragon. He fought very bravely, won the fight and killed the dragon. George and the princess returned to the village and everyone was very pleased that they would have no problems with the dragon. Today, the story of George's bravery is remembered and George is known as the patron saint of many countries.Setelah membaca teks diatas, tolong isikan tabel digambar 3 nomor saja​</a>

So, one of the big fish came to see the dragon and told the dragon that there was another dragon coming to challenge him to fight. The dragon was furious about the challenge, so he agreed to wait for the other dragon coming to fight. While he awaited his rival impatiently, he was swimming here and there to calm himself. The water moved fiercely as he moved. The dragon thought that the water movement was because of the other dragon coming.

                                            Biwar and The DragonOne day, the people from the village of Mimika were very busy. They prepared twelve boats and set off on a journey to find sago (traditional food of the people in the island of Papua). After three days, their boats were filled with sago. But on their way back to the village, they were attacked by a dragon. The dragon’s tail caused a big wave in the river. Most of the villagers were drown, but there’s a woman who managed to save herself. She was hanging to a tree log and finally arrives in a land.The woman was the only survivor from the incident. She was pregnant. Her boat was broken so she couldn’t go back to the village. The woman then lived in the forest near the river. Later she gave birth to a son. She named her son Biwar. He grew up as a skillful hunter. He can make various weapons, set traps to catch animals, and provided sufficient food for both of them.One day he brought some fish for their food. When his mother saw him bringing fish, she asked where Biwar got them. He said it was from the river. The mother was still afraid of the dragon, so she forbade Biwar to go near the river again. She also told him about his father and the villagers that were killed by the dragon, “Your father was killed by the dragon. I’m the only one survived from the incident. That’s why we live alone here, Son.”Biwar then decided to hunt the dragon so that he and his mother could go back to the village. He set traps near the river. Then he made some noise by playing the tifa (traditional drums). Attracted by the noise, the dragon came to Biwar. When the dragon started to attack, Biwar pulled the rope that linked to his traps, releasing spears that hit the dragon’s head directly. The dragon died instantly.Biwar then came to his mother and told her about the death of the dragon. The next day, he built a boat and set sail to return to the village. When they arrived in the village, all the people were so happy to hear the news about the dragon’s death. Thanks to Biwar, they are not afraid to sail in the river anymore.Narative text yang termasuk orientation,complication,resulation​</a>

Read the following text and answer the question!
There once lived on the island of Negros a princess named Anina who lived a very sheltered life.
One day, Anina overheard her father talking to the kingdom's chief priestess. The priestess was frantic about a report that they could not find a single maiden who was unblemished.
Later, Anina asked her father what it was all about, and the king finally broke down. There had long been a seven-headed dragon threatening the kingdom, and the monster could only be appeased if an unblemished maiden was sacrificed to it.
In fear, all the women in the kingdom had cut themselves to disqualify themselves from the sacrifice. Parents cut their own baby girls so as to spare the infants from the sacrifice. But the king and the queen couldn't bring themselves to mar their daughter's beauty, and so Anina was the only remaining unscarred female in the kingdom.
Anina did not weep. Instead, she willingly offered herself for the sacrifice. Fortuitously, on the day she was to be brought to the mountain where the dragon lived, a man calling himself Khan Laon appeared. Khan in his language meant ‘a noble lord'. He said he came from a kingdom far away in order to slay the dragon and spare Anina's life.
No one believed the dragon could be killed, but Khan Laon insisted that his ability to talk to animals would help him. He asked the help of the ants, the bees, and the eagles.
The ants swarmed over the dragon's body and crept under its scales to bite its soft, unprotected flesh, while the bees stung the fourteen eyes of the dragon till it was blind. The largest eagle carried Khan Laon to the mountain where he was able to easily chop off the seven heads of the writhing beast.
In gratitude, the king gave Khan Laon his daughter Anina to be his bride, and the people named the mountain after the noble lord.
And that is how, according to the story, Mount Kanlaon got its name. That it is a volcano is because of the spirit of the dead dragon.</a>

The dragon lived there peacefully. He also ate fish which he could find easily in the river. However, big fish living in the river felt threatened by him because they were afraid someday the dragon would eat them too. So, one of the big fish came to see the dragon and told the dragon that there was another dragon coming to challenge him to fight. The dragon was furious about the challenge, so he agreed to wait for the other dragon coming to fight. While he awaited his rival impatiently, he was swimming here and there to calm himself. The water moved fiercely as he moved. The dragon thought that the water movement was because of the other dragon coming. So, when he saw a tail, he bit and pulled the tail fiercely until he bit it off. He, soon, realized that it was his own tail, but that was just too late.

                            3. George and the DragonOnce upon a time there was a brave knight called George. George had lots of adventures as he travelled by horse across many lands.One day he cam to a small village and met a man who lived in a cave next to the village. The hermit told the knight about the awful things that were happening there. A terrible dragon had come to live in the lake and attacked the village every day.The villagers didn't know what to do. First, they gave the dragon all their food, but the dragon just took the food and still attacked the village. So then the villagers gave the dragon all the animals from their farms. The dragon took all the animals, but continued to attack the villagers. So then they gave the dragon all their gold and jewels. The dragon took all their money, but still was not satisfied.The king sent his army to try and capture the dragon, but the dragon was too strong and the knights of the army were too scared and they ran away. With nothing left to give, the king could only think of one thing to help protect his people. He sent his only daughter, the princess, to the lake to wait for the dragon. The princess was scared, but she tried to calm down.When George heard this he rode as fast as he could to the lake. Just then the dragon jumped out from the lake and was going to eat the princess. George attacked the dragon. He fought very bravely, won the fight and killed the dragon. George and the princess returned to the village and everyone was very pleased that they would have no problems with the dragon. Today, the story of George's bravery is remembered and George is known as the patron saint of many countries.Setelah membaca teks diatas, tolong isikan tabel digambar 3 nomor saja​</h2><br />

                            6. One day, a farmer found a giant egg and decided to cook and eat it. After eating the egg, he gradually changed into a giant dragon. The giant dragon decided to live in a deep river near his village because he realized that he could not live with humans anymore. The dragon lived there peacefully. He also ate fish which he could find easily in the river. However, big fish living in the river felt threatened by him because they were afraid someday the dragon would eat them too. So, one of the big fish came to see the dragon and told the dragon that there was another dragon coming to challenge him to fight. The dragon was furious about the challenge, so he agreed to wait for the other dragon coming to fight. While he awaited his rival impatiently, he was swimming here and there to calm himself. The water moved fiercely as he moved. The dragon thought that the water movement was because of the other dragon coming. So, when he saw a tail, he bit and pulled the tail fiercely until he bit it off. He, soon, realized that it was his own tail, but that was just too late. The dragon died because of losing too much blood. 38.

                            9. Biwar and The DragonOne day, the people from the village of Mimika were very busy. They prepared twelve boats and set off on a journey to find sago (traditional food of the people in the island of Papua). After three days, their boats were filled with sago. But on their way back to the village, they were attacked by a dragon. The dragon’s tail caused a big wave in the river. Most of the villagers were drown, but there’s a woman who managed to save herself. She was hanging to a tree log and finally arrives in a land.The woman was the only survivor from the incident. She was pregnant. Her boat was broken so she couldn’t go back to the village. The woman then lived in the forest near the river. Later she gave birth to a son. She named her son Biwar. He grew up as a skillful hunter. He can make various weapons, set traps to catch animals, and provided sufficient food for both of them.One day he brought some fish for their food. When his mother saw him bringing fish, she asked where Biwar got them. He said it was from the river. The mother was still afraid of the dragon, so she forbade Biwar to go near the river again. She also told him about his father and the villagers that were killed by the dragon, “Your father was killed by the dragon. I’m the only one survived from the incident. That’s why we live alone here, Son.”Biwar then decided to hunt the dragon so that he and his mother could go back to the village. He set traps near the river. Then he made some noise by playing the tifa (traditional drums). Attracted by the noise, the dragon came to Biwar. When the dragon started to attack, Biwar pulled the rope that linked to his traps, releasing spears that hit the dragon’s head directly. The dragon died instantly.Biwar then came to his mother and told her about the death of the dragon. The next day, he built a boat and set sail to return to the village. When they arrived in the village, all the people were so happy to hear the news about the dragon’s death. Thanks to Biwar, they are not afraid to sail in the river anymore.Narative text yang termasuk orientation,complication,resulation​</h2><br />

Read the following text and answer the question!
There once lived on the island of Negros a princess named Anina who lived a very sheltered life.
One day, Anina overheard her father talking to the kingdom's chief priestess. The priestess was frantic about a report that they could not find a single maiden who was unblemished.
Later, Anina asked her father what it was all about, and the king finally broke down. There had long been a seven-headed dragon threatening the kingdom, and the monster could only be appeased if an unblemished maiden was sacrificed to it.
In fear, all the women in the kingdom had cut themselves to disqualify themselves from the sacrifice. Parents cut their own baby girls so as to spare the infants from the sacrifice. But the king and the queen couldn't bring themselves to mar their daughter's beauty, and so Anina was the only remaining unscarred female in the kingdom.
Anina did not weep. Instead, she willingly offered herself for the sacrifice. Fortuitously, on the day she was to be brought to the mountain where the dragon lived, a man calling himself Khan Laon appeared. Khan in his language meant ‘a noble lord'. He said he came from a kingdom far away in order to slay the dragon and spare Anina's life.
No one believed the dragon could be killed, but Khan Laon insisted that his ability to talk to animals would help him. He asked the help of the ants, the bees, and the eagles.
The ants swarmed over the dragon's body and crept under its scales to bite its soft, unprotected flesh, while the bees stung the fourteen eyes of the dragon till it was blind. The largest eagle carried Khan Laon to the mountain where he was able to easily chop off the seven heads of the writhing beast.
In gratitude, the king gave Khan Laon his daughter Anina to be his bride, and the people named the mountain after the noble lord.
And that is how, according to the story, Mount Kanlaon got its name. That it is a volcano is because of the spirit of the dead dragon.</h2><br />
