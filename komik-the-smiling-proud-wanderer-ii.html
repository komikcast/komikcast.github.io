The wanderer asked where the devil lived. “In a castle not far from here,” said the old woman.The wanderer went to the castle. There she found the devil, but he was old and weak.

                                            The Magic Candle One day, a young wanderer got lost in the wood. Suddenly, he saw a light from an old hut. He knocked on the door, and old woman opened it. She was crying. She said that a devil had stolen her magic candle. The candle could grant anything she asked. The wanderer asked her where the devil lived. “in a castle not far from here,” said the old woman. The wanderer went to the castle. There he found the devil, but he was old and weak. Therefore, when the wanderer grabbed the magic candle from the devil’s table and ran away, he couldn’t chase him. However, the wanderer was not a kind man. He didn’t return the candle to the old woman, but kept it for himself. He lit the candle and made a wish, “I want to go far away from here.” Suddenly, a genie appeared and took him to a beautiful palace. The wanderer wanted to make some money. So, he lit the candle again and wished for some jewelry. He sold them to the guests and was soon making a lot of money. Then, a princess came to buy some jewelry, but there was nothing left. The wanderer fell in love with her and asked her to marry him. The kind princess said yes, and they got married the next day. In his happiness, the wanderer told the princess about his adventure and the magic candle. Hearing that, the princess got very angry. At night, she lit the candle and wished the wanderer disappeared.

Dia mengetuk pintu, dan wanita tua membukanya. Dia menangis. Dia mengatakan bahwa iblis telah mencuri lilin ajaibnya. Lilin bisa memberikan apa yang dia minta. Pengembara itu bertanya dimana iblis tinggal. "Di sebuah kastil tidak jauh dari sini," kata wanita tua itu. Pengembara itu pergi ke kastil. Di sana ia menemukan iblis tapi ia sudah tua dan lemah. Karena itu saat pengembara merampas lilin ajaib dari meja iblis dan lari, dia tak bisa mengejarnya. Tapi pengelana itu bukan orang baik. Dia tidak mengembalikan lilin kepada wanita tua itu, tapi menyimpannya untuk dirinya sendiri. Dia menyalakan lilin dan membuat keinginan, "aku ingin pergi jauh dari sini" tiba-tiba genies muncul dan membawanya ke sebuah istana yang indah. Ada pesta di istana. The wanderer ingin membuat beberapa uang. Jadi dia menyalakan lilin lagi dan berharap untuk beberapa perhiasan. Ia menjualnya kepada para tamu dan segera mendapat banyak uang. Kemudian sang putri datang untuk membeli perhiasan, tapi tidak ada yang tersisa. Wanderer jatuh cinta dengan dia dan memintanya untuk menikah dengannya. Putri yang baik hati itu menjawab ya, dan mereka menikah keesokan harinya. Dalam kebahagiaan ini, si pengembara menceritakan pada sang putri tentang petualangannya dan lilin ajaibnya. Mendengar itu, sang putri menjadi sangat marah. Pada malam hari ia menyalakan lilin dan berharap bahwa wanderer menghilang. Pada pagi hari, si pengembara terbangun dan kembali ke rumahnya yang buruk di sebuah pertanyaan di desa: 6.</p><br />

                            23.        One day a young wanderer got lost in a wood. Suddenly he was a light from an old hut. He knocked on the door, and old woman opened it. She was crying. She said that the devil had stolen her magic candle. The candle could grant anything she asked. The wanderer asked where the devil lived. “In a castle not far from here,” said the old woman. 
        The wanderer went to the castle. There she found the devil, but he was old and weak. Therefore when the wanderer grabbed the magic candle from the devil’s table and ran away, he couldn’t chase him.
         But the wanderer was not a kind man. He didn’t return the candle to the old woman, but kept it for himself. He lit the candle and made a wish, “I want to go far away from here.” Suddenly the genies appeared and took him to a beautiful palace. There was a party in the palace. The wanderer wanted to make some money. So he lit the candle again and wished for some jewellery. He sold them to the guests and was soon making a lot of money. Then the Princess came to buy the jewellery, but there was nothing left.  The wanderer fell in love with her and asked her to marry him. The kind Princess said yes, and they got married the next day.

How is the characterization of the Wanderer?2. What is the problem in the story?3. What is the end of the story?4. What is the moral value of the story?Tolong di bantu kakTerimakasih ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p>The characterization of the wanderer is as a young, selfish, and greedy person.The problem in the story is the devil stole the old woman's magic candle and the wanderer took the candle for himself and used it for his own gain.The end of the story is that the wanderer, who had fallen in love with a princess and married her, is sent back to his original home by the princess after she found out about the magic candle.The moral value of the story could be that greed and selfishness will ultimately lead to one's downfall and that one should not take advantage of others for personal gain.<br />
