                                            In a small village, a girl lives with her mother. The girl is very beautiful. Everyday she puts make-up and wears her best clothes. She doesn't like to help her mother work in a field. The girl is very lazy. One day, the mother asks the girl to accompany her to go to the market to buy some food. At first the girl refuses, but the mother persuades her by saying they are going to buy new clothes. The girl finally agrees. But she asks her mother to walk behind her. She doesn't want to walk side by side with her mother. Although her mother is very sad, she agrees to walk behind her daughter. On the way to the market, everybody admires the girl's beauty. They are also curious. Behind the beautiful girl, there is an old woman with a simple dress. The girl and her mother look very different! "Hello, pretty lady. Who is the woman behind you?" asks them. "She is my servant," answers the girl. The mother is very sad, but she doesn't say anything. The girl and the mother meet other people. "Hello, beauty. Who is the woman behind you?" asks them again. Again the girl answers that her mother is her servant. She always says that her mother is her servant every time they meet people. At last, the mother cannot hold the pain anymore. She prays to God to punish her daughter. God answers her prayer. Slowly, the girl's leg turns into stone. The process continues to the upper part of the girl's body. The girl is very panicky. "Mother, please forgive me!" she cries and ask her mother to forgive her. But it's too late. Her whole body finally becomes a big stone. Until now people still can see tears falling down the stone. People then call it the crying stone or in Indonesian mean batu menangis. 1. What is the main idea of the story? 2. Who are the characters in the story? 3. What was the character of the daughter? 4. What did the mother ask the God to punish her daughter? 5. Tell about the moral value of the story 6. What is the final destiny of the daughter. terjemahkan bahasa Indonesia?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:Di sebuah desa kecil, seorang gadis tinggal bersama ibunya. Gadis itu sangat cantik. Setiap hari dia merias wajah dan mengenakan pakaian terbaiknya. Dia tidak suka membantu ibunya bekerja di ladang. Gadis itu sangat malas. Suatu hari, sang ibu meminta gadis itu untuk menemaninya pergi ke pasar untuk membeli makanan. Awalnya gadis itu menolak, tapi ibunya membujuknya dengan mengatakan mereka akan membeli baju baru. Gadis itu akhirnya setuju. Tapi dia meminta ibunya untuk berjalan di belakangnya. Dia tidak mau berjalan berdampingan dengan ibunya. Meski ibunya sangat sedih, dia setuju untuk berjalan di belakang putrinya. Dalam perjalanan ke pasar, semua orang mengagumi kecantikan gadis itu. Mereka juga penasaran. Di belakang gadis cantik itu, ada seorang wanita tua dengan pakaian sederhana. Gadis itu dan ibunya terlihat sangat berbeda! "Halo, nona cantik. Siapa wanita di belakangmu?" tanya mereka. "Dia adalah pelayanku," jawab gadis itu. Sang ibu sangat sedih, tetapi dia tidak mengatakan apa-apa. Gadis dan ibunya bertemu orang lain. "Halo, cantik. Siapa wanita di belakangmu?" tanya mereka lagi. Lagi-lagi gadis itu menjawab bahwa ibunya adalah pelayannya. Dia selalu mengatakan bahwa ibunya adalah pelayannya setiap kali mereka bertemu orang. Akhirnya sang ibu tidak bisa menahan rasa sakit lagi. Dia berdoa kepada Tuhan untuk menghukum putrinya. Tuhan menjawab doanya. Perlahan, kaki gadis itu berubah menjadi batu. Proses berlanjut ke bagian atas tubuh gadis itu. Gadis itu sangat panik. "Ibu, tolong maafkan aku!" dia menangis dan meminta ibunya untuk memaafkannya. Tapi sudah terlambat. Seluruh tubuhnya akhirnya menjadi batu besar. Sampai sekarang orang masih bisa melihat air mata yang jatuh dari batu.

Gadis itu sangat cantik. Dia merias wajah dan mengenakan pakaian terbaiknya setiap hari. Dia tidak suka membantu ibunya bekerja di ladang. Gadis itu sangat malas Suatu hari, sang ibu meminta gadis itu untuk menemaninya pergi ke pasar untuk membeli makanan. Awalnya gadis itu menolak, tetapi sang ibu membujuknya dengan mengatakan mereka akan membeli baju baru. Gadis itu akhirnya setuju dengan satu syarat bahwa ibunya harus berjalan di belakangnya. Dia tidak mau berjalan berdampingan dengan ibunya Meskipun ibunya sangat sedih, dia setuju untuk berjalan di belakang putrinya. Dalam perjalanan ke pasar, semua orang mengagumi kecantikan gadis itu. Mereka juga penasaran. Di belakang gadis cantik itu, ada seorang wanita tua dengan gaun sederhana. Gadis itu dan ibunya terlihat sangat berbeda! "Halo, nona cantik. Siapa wanita di belakangmu?" tanya mereka. "Dia adalah pelayanku," jawab gadis itu. "Halo cantik. Siapa wanita di belakangmu?" tanya mereka lagi. Lagi-lagi, gadis itu menjawab hal yang sama. Dia selalu mengatakan bahwa ibunya adalah pelayannya setiap kali bertemu orang Akhirnya, ibu tidak bisa menahan rasa sakit lagi. Dia berdoa kepada Tuhan untuk menghukum putrinya Tuhan menjawab doanya. Perlahan, kaki gadis itu berubah menjadi batu. Dia menyadari sesuatu yang salah. Proses berlanjut ke bagian atas tubuh gil. Gadis itu sangat panik. "Ibu, tolong maafkan aku!" dia menangis dan meminta ibunya untuk memaafkannya Tapi sudah terlambat.

She doesn't like to help her mother work in a field. The girl is very lazy. One day, the mother asks the girl to accompany her to go to the market to buy some food. At first the girl refuses, but the mother persuades her by saying they are going to buy new clothes. The girl finally agrees. But she asks her mother to walk behind her. She doesn't want to walk side by side with her mother. Although her mother is very sad, she agrees to walk behind her daughter. On the way to the market, everybody admires the girl's beauty. They are also curious. Behind the beautiful girl, there is an old woman with a simple dress. The girl and her mother look very different! "Hello, pretty lady. Who is the woman behind you?" asks them. "She is my servant," answers the girl. The mother is very sad, but she doesn't say anything. The girl and the mother meet other people. "Hello, beauty. Who is the woman behind you?" asks them again. Again the girl answers that her mother is her servant. She always says that her mother is her servant every time they meet people. At last, the mother cannot hold the pain anymore. She prays to God to punish her daughter. God answers her prayer. Slowly, the girl's leg turns into stone. The process continues to the upper part of the girl's body. The girl is very panicky. "Mother, please forgive me!" she cries and ask her mother to forgive her. But it's too late. Her whole body finally becomes a big stone. Until now people still can see tears falling down the stone.
