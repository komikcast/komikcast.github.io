When the earthquake happened, I was in my car. I was driving home from my vacation from Bali.
Suddenly my car launched to one side, to the left. I thought I got a flat tire. I did not know that I
was an earthquake. I knew it was an earthquake when I saw some telephone and electricity poles
falling down to the ground, like matchstick.
Then I saw a lot of rock tumbling across the road. I was trapped by the rocks. I could not move
my car at all. There were rocks everywhere. There was nothing I could do but leave the car and
walk along way to my house, in town. When I reach my town. I was so surprise that there was
almost nothing left the earthquake did not a lot of damage to my town. Al thought nothing was
left. I thank God that nobody was seriously injured.

                                            I was born in Surabaya on July 9, 2019. When I was child I was noisy and annoying, I always asked about anything, until some people scolded me because I was annoying. even worse, I am a dissident. and I think I'm much better now. when I was two years old I went to early childhood school, my mother sent me because the housing where I lived was so quiet that I had no friends. when i was six years old i entered elementary school, i was in first grade and i threw out stranger jewelry when wee playing together, i was very panicked at that time. and when the second grade the stranger became my classmate and became my best friend until now. sadly we had to part cause I changed schools and moved to SMPN 70. I think my new teacher is much better than my old teacher that's why I am happy to move here.Hallo kak, boleh tolong di koreksiTerimakasih yaa..​</a>

I thought he know what I am doing.Then, we went into the rides. At the entrance stilllooks a little light, but deeper, becomes darker.I'm scared to death. I wanted to get out soon, butI can not. Because we ride a vehicle like a smallcar that runs slowly. Because of using seatbelt,then I can not get out of the car.Somehow the car became slower andslower. Until finally stopped in front of a coffin.Before long, there was a dracula that came out ofthe box suddenly. I was startled, just as surprisedwhen I heard the sound of thunder.And suddenly the car ran very fast, fasterthan when we entered the rides. We passedsome places on the right and left there werepictures and scary ghost statues.

I went there with George and Tina. We wore fancy dress because it was a fancy dress party. I wore a ghost costurne Tina became Xena, the warrior princes, and George was a vampire. The party started at 7 p.m. First, we sang "Happy Birthday". Then, Sarah blew the candies. After that, we ate some food and drank coke. Later on, we did some games. Everybody enjoyed them. I cheered so hard that I nearly lost my voice. While we were playing "Hide and Seek”, the lights suddenly went out. Some girls screamed because they were afraid of the dark. Fortunately, it didn't take long. In ten minutes, the light went on again, and we continued of the game. Before the party was over, the MC announced the best costume of the party. George got the first prize. He looked so happy. Finally, my Dad arrived to take me home. I was so tired, but happy.                          terjemahkan ke dlm bahasa indonesia​</a>

At that lake, I looked for the best point to fish. I went to the place under the big tree at the bank of the lake.
I threw my hook as far as I can then I wait for the fish eating my bait. 30 minutes left and finally there was a fish ate my bait. It was the first big enough fish that I got.
I got 10 big fish and 3 small fish at that day. I was so happy.
I would cook that fish at home and then I would call my friends to come to my home then we would have a small party.
But I was not lucky enough because on the way home I saw a beggar. He was an old poor beggar.
I gave all of my fish to him and I wish he would be happy getting that fish. Perhaps he could sell them at the market and get some money to buy some food.

As I looked, I saw the house opposite began to fall sideways. Then I realized what was happening. I put on my dressing gown hurriedly and rushed out into the garden.I was alone in the house, my wife and children had gone to visit my mother in law.For three or four minutes, I heard a terrible noise of walls falling down, and people screaming, and I saw clouds of dust in the air.

                                            A Page from A Girl’s DiaryTuesday, September 30th, 2008It was takbiran night. It was also my birthday, and nothing happened. Or I had thought nothing would happen, but I was wrong.That night, I was watching television with my family when I heard someone lit fireworks in my front yard. I peeped through my window glass but could see nothing. It was very dark outside. Then I thought it had to be my cousins who lit the fireworks. Then I plopped down on my sofa again and tried to concentrate on the television since my mind raced with disappointment that no one gave something special on my birthday.I shrugged, it was almost the end of the day and I became pessimist. Five minutes later my mobile beeped. It was a text from my friend asking me to come out. Wondering what was going on, I grabbed my jacket and hurried to the front door. I was surprised to see her bring a bag full of firework and fire drills. Next I was surprised to see my other friend come out from the darkness. She brought a beautiful birthday cake on her hands. Oh my God! I shrieked. Then they gave the cake to me who was too stunned to say anything. I realized I was blushing furiously because my whole family was watching. Not to mention my neighbors too!A plain day, or I thought it was before, turned out to be one of the greatest moment in my life. I didn’t even know how to describe what I felt. Happy was the simplest word.Answer the questions below1. Write the information you have read from the text abovea. The orientationb. The eventsc. the re-orientation2.

Suddenly my car launched to one side, to the left. I thought I got a flat tire. I did not know that I
was an earthquake. I knew it was an earthquake when I saw some telephone and electricity poles
falling down to the ground, like matchstick.
Then I saw a lot of rock tumbling across the road. I was trapped by the rocks. I could not move
my car at all. There were rocks everywhere. There was nothing I could do but leave the car and
walk along way to my house, in town. When I reach my town. I was so surprise that there was
almost nothing left the earthquake did not a lot of damage to my town. Al thought nothing was
left. I thank God that nobody was seriously injured.

                            26. Event
At that lake, I looked for the best point to fish. I went to the place under the big tree at the bank of the lake.
I threw my hook as far as I can then I wait for the fish eating my bait. 30 minutes left and finally there was a fish ate my bait. It was the first big enough fish that I got.
I got 10 big fish and 3 small fish at that day. I was so happy.
I would cook that fish at home and then I would call my friends to come to my home then we would have a small party.
But I was not lucky enough because on the way home I saw a beggar. He was an old poor beggar.
I gave all of my fish to him and I wish he would be happy getting that fish. Perhaps he could sell them at the market and get some money to buy some food.

                        Saya baru saja tidur sekitar setengah jam kemudian ketika saya merasakan getaran. Tempat tidur mulai bergetar dan kulihat lampu listrik yang tergantung di langit-langit bergoyang-goyang.

Kemudian, saya keluar dari tempat tidur dengan cepat dan pergi untuk melihat ke luar jendela. Saat aku melihat, aku melihat rumah di seberang mulai jatuh . Lalu aku menyadari apa yang sedang terjadi. Aku mengenakan gaun dengan tergesa-gesa dan bergegas keluar ke kebun.

Saya sendirian di rumah, istri dan anak-anak saya pergi untuk mengunjungi ibu mertua saya.

Selama tiga atau empat menit, saya mendengar suara bising dinding runtuh, dan orang-orang menjerit, dan saya melihat awan debu di udara. Lalu gemetar berhenti.

                            29. A Page from A Girl’s DiaryTuesday, September 30th, 2008It was takbiran night. It was also my birthday, and nothing happened. Or I had thought nothing would happen, but I was wrong.That night, I was watching television with my family when I heard someone lit fireworks in my front yard. I peeped through my window glass but could see nothing. It was very dark outside. Then I thought it had to be my cousins who lit the fireworks. Then I plopped down on my sofa again and tried to concentrate on the television since my mind raced with disappointment that no one gave something special on my birthday.I shrugged, it was almost the end of the day and I became pessimist. Five minutes later my mobile beeped. It was a text from my friend asking me to come out. Wondering what was going on, I grabbed my jacket and hurried to the front door. I was surprised to see her bring a bag full of firework and fire drills. Next I was surprised to see my other friend come out from the darkness. She brought a beautiful birthday cake on her hands. Oh my God! I shrieked. Then they gave the cake to me who was too stunned to say anything. I realized I was blushing furiously because my whole family was watching. Not to mention my neighbors too!A plain day, or I thought it was before, turned out to be one of the greatest moment in my life. I didn’t even know how to describe what I felt.

It's the best Halloween experience ever.</p><p></p><p><strong>Translation </strong></p><p>Aku mulai keluar dari rumahku dari jam delapan malam. Aku mengetuk  pintu dari rumah ke rumah di sekeliling tetanggaku sambil bilang "trick or treat".  Aku  mendapatkan banyak permen dari mereka. Setelah mengumpulkan  permen, aku dan teman-temanku pergi ke taman tempat semua anak-anak berkumpul. Kami makan dan  membagikan permen kami. Dan tepat jam 9 malam.  Kami berkumpul di tengah taman untuk bergabung dalam pesta.  Pesta dimulai  dengan lagu yang dimainkan oleh band saudara ku. Aku tidak begitu mengenal dengan lagu yang dinyanyikan oleh mereka.  Tapi  aku tidak menyukainya sama sekali. Itu m e m e k a k kan telingaku. Setelah itu, pesta dilanjutkan dengan sesi  sharing. Beberapa dari kami berbagi pengalaman menakutkan mereka. Beberapa cerita mereka benar-benar membuat aku  ketakutan. Bulu kuduk ku merinding di tangan dan leher </p><p>Dan tepatnya  setelah sesi sharing berakhir, pesta ditutup kembali oleh lagu yang mengerikan  oleh band saudaraku.  Aku dan teman-temanku tidak berani pulang ke rumah kami masing-masing. Kami pulang bareng-bareng. Aku sampai di rumah pada tengah malam. Aku ketakutan bercampur gembira. Ini pengalaman halloween terbaik yang pernah aku rasakan.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Note :</strong></p><p><strong>Tips mengerjakan teks rumpang :</strong></p><p>1.
