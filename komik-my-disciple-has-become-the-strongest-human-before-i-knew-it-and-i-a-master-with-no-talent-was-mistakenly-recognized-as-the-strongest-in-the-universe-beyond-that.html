                                            On my daughter's 1st birthday, I made a cake for her. I decorated it with the Disney characters, Mickey Mouse
and Donald Duck It was such a wonderful experience for me. My wife inspired me to make this special
birthday cake. She is very good at making cakes.
On that day, I went and got all items for the cake. I had never made a cake before, so I felt a little bit nervous.
Before I made the cake, I imagined how to decorate it, then I started right away. I chose the flavour. I made a
cake with chocolate flavour. I followed the steps in the recipe carefully. And finally I could make it. It was not
bad at all.
All the people and the children who were invited to the birthday party liked the cake. I was very proud. My wife
told the guests that I made the birthday cake. I felt satisfied when they were surprised that I could make a
cake. Since then making cakes has become one of my hobbies.

I'm still happy now indeed. I can't still believe in winning the national competition. It was my first competition. I won the first place, though. It was because of support from my family, teachers, and friends. And of course, it's because of my hard work. I practiced every day before the competition. I practiced in the morning and in the afternoon. terjemahkan ke bahasa indonesia​</a>

 Last week, l went to the lake for fishing. It was the suitable time for fishing because I had nothing to do in my holiday. I went there with my friends.
 I woke up earlier in the morning and prepared everything. Not long after that, my friends came and we went to the lake we have decided before to start fishing. Arriving at the lake, I directly searched the best spot to get a giant fish. After searching for about ten minutes, finally I found the spot. It was under the big tree at the bank of the lake. I threw my hook as far as I could then I waited for the fish eating my bait. It had been 15 minutes and i finally saw the sign that there was a fish eating my bait. I tried to pull it up and i succeeded. I got a three kilogram fish. I was so excited. I threw the hook again and again. I got more than ten fish that day. I enjoyed the moment so much that i didn’t realized that the sun had already set. I called my friends and we went home.</a>

                                            A bad dayMy day was a nightmare ! I had a job interview this morning but I forgot to set the alarm clock . I overslept and couldn't have a shower or breakfast . I went to the garage putting on my shoes and setting my hair at the same time . The car wouldn't start , and I was only able to make it work at the third time I tried . The traffic was awful and I arrived at the parking garage 5 minutes before the interview . Luckily I found a spot , but a guy in a red Mercedes tried to take it . I cut him off and managed to put my car there and of course - he didn't like it , he complained not in a nice way and I had to tell him what I think of people like him . I was quarreling with the jerk when I slammed my finger in the car door , and I was so nervous that I didn't notice the keys were still in the car and locked it . I didn't have time to deal with it at that moment , so I rushed to arrive for the interview on time and guess who the interviewer was : the guy I met at the parking garage ! I wish I hadn't gotten up today .Number the bad things that happened to the woman :What would you do if you were in the woman's place ?What would you have done differently ? Why ?How would you feel after a day like that ?Have you ever had a day like that? tell it was​</a>

As I stepped in the bathroom, I landed my foot on soap in the floor and feel down. Next, I began my jogging and saw my gorgeous neighbor, jogging to. I thought it was a good fortune to omit the gap between us. So I jogged to him and say hello. How poor of me, it was not him. It just someone I had never met before who looked like to him. I was going home with people laugh at me along side of the street. When I got home, the breakfast already settled and I immediately spooned a big portion of rice and ate. After I have done my breakfast my mother came up and said that the meal has not ready yet and she said that I may have a stomachache if I ate it. It was proved; I had a stomachache for the next three days. I past my weekend lie down on me bed and be served as a queen. That was not really bad, wasn't it? 10. What does the text tell us about?A.

I had been practicing for weeks and I had the whole dance memorized. When I got to theperformance hall, I put on my new shoes and hat. I checked my reflection in the mirror. “I look good!” I thought with a grin. It was almost my turnto perform, so I peeked out from behind the curtain. There were somany people in the audience! I began to feel a little nervous. But then I saw my parents smiling in the front row. “I can do this!” I thought to myself. When the curtain opened and the music started, I felt myconfidence grow as I remembered all the steps I had practiced.First, I heard the beat get fast, so I did a quick spin and tipped my hat.When the beat slowed down, I did a shuNe and twist. I was almost finished dancing, when suddenly, I saw that there was a loose boardat the front of the stage. But it was too late, I tripped over it and almost fell off stage! I caught myself just in time and jumped backward, pretending like it was just part of my dance. The music ended and I bowed. Everyone inthe audience jumped to their feet and clapped. My parents were cheering loudest of all. I was so happy that I did a little jig and smiled before walking off stage. After the performance was over, my coach gave me a pat on theback and said, “Nice job, Marcus!” My parents were so proud of me, they took me to get ice cream​</a>

Two days ago I was in the bus station to pick my brother up for his arrival.
I was playing my phone all the time in that afternoon. I sat in the bench right near the ticket keeper. Then, I bought a bottle of water across the ticket keeper. I forgot to take my phone with me when I bought water. Then I saw my brother out of the bus. I ran to him and we were about to go. That time I thought I lost my phone. My brother told me to check it in the place before. I came back and the ticket keeper told me that he saved the phone for me. I thanked him and we said our good bye.
I was afraid that I would lose my phone. Lucky I still had it back.</a>

 I woke up earlier in the morning and prepared everything. Not long after that, my friends came and we went to the lake we have decided before to start fishing. Arriving at the lake, I directly searched the best spot to get a giant fish. After searching for about ten minutes, finally I found the spot. It was under the big tree at the bank of the lake. I threw my hook as far as I could then I waited for the fish eating my bait. It had been 15 minutes and i finally saw the sign that there was a fish eating my bait. I tried to pull it up and i succeeded. I got a three kilogram fish. I was so excited. I threw the hook again and again. I got more than ten fish that day. I enjoyed the moment so much that i didn’t realized that the sun had already set. I called my friends and we went home.</h2><br />

                            17. A bad dayMy day was a nightmare ! I had a job interview this morning but I forgot to set the alarm clock . I overslept and couldn't have a shower or breakfast . I went to the garage putting on my shoes and setting my hair at the same time . The car wouldn't start , and I was only able to make it work at the third time I tried . The traffic was awful and I arrived at the parking garage 5 minutes before the interview . Luckily I found a spot , but a guy in a red Mercedes tried to take it . I cut him off and managed to put my car there and of course - he didn't like it , he complained not in a nice way and I had to tell him what I think of people like him . I was quarreling with the jerk when I slammed my finger in the car door , and I was so nervous that I didn't notice the keys were still in the car and locked it . I didn't have time to deal with it at that moment , so I rushed to arrive for the interview on time and guess who the interviewer was : the guy I met at the parking garage ! I wish I hadn't gotten up today .Number the bad things that happened to the woman :What would you do if you were in the woman's place ?What would you have done differently ? Why ?How would you feel after a day like that ?Have you ever had a day like that? tell it was​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. It sounds like the woman had quite a series of unfortunate events. Here's the numbered list of the bad things that happened to her:</p><p></p><p>- Overslept due to not setting the alarm clock.</p><p>- Missed shower and breakfast.</p><p>- The car wouldn't start initially.</p><p>- Traffic was terrible.</p><p>- I arrived just 5 minutes before the interview.</p><p>- Conflict over a parking spot with another driver.</p><p>- Slammed her finger in the car door.</p><p>- Locked her keys in the car.</p><p>- The interviewer turned out to be the person from the parking garage.</p><p></p><p>2. If I were in her place, I would probably try to remain as calm as possible and focus on finding solutions to each problem one at a time. It's essential not to let the stress of the situation further escalate things.</p><p></p><p>3. To handle the situation differently, the woman could have set multiple alarms to avoid oversleeping, left earlier to account for potential traffic, and refrained from getting into a conflict over the parking spot, as it only added to her stress.</p><p></p><p>4. After a day like that, I imagine she would feel incredibly frustrated, stressed, and exhausted. The accumulation of unfortunate events can take a toll on anyone's emotional state.</p><p></p><p>5. I woke up super late because my dumb alarm didn't go off properly. Then, I spilled my breakfast all over my favorite hoodie and missed my school bus. So then I used a bike to school but then it suddenly pouring rain totally ruined my hair and my notebook got soaked. When I finally got to class, I realized I left my super important project at home. The day got worse when my bike got a flat tire on the way back, and I had to wait forever for my dad to pick me up. Finally, I got home, and the power was out, so I couldn't even relax with my phone.</p><br />

As I stepped in the bathroom, I landed my foot on soap in the floor and feel down. Next, I began my jogging and saw my gorgeous neighbor, jogging to. I thought it was a good fortune to omit the gap between us. So I jogged to him and say hello. How poor of me, it was not him. It just someone I had never met before who looked like to him. I was going home with people laugh at me along side of the street. When I got home, the breakfast already settled and I immediately spooned a big portion of rice and ate. After I have done my breakfast my mother came up and said that the meal has not ready yet and she said that I may have a stomachache if I ate it. It was proved; I had a stomachache for the next three days. I past my weekend lie down on me bed and be served as a queen. That was not really bad, wasn't it? 10. What does the text tell us about?A.

                            34. Why  has digital literacy become the vital competency that students need to master before graduating?</h2><br />
                        <p>Digital literacy has become a vital competency that students need to master before graduating due to several reasons:</p><p></p><p>Ubiquity of Technology: Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. It is present in almost every aspect of society, from education and work to communication and entertainment. In order to thrive in the digital age, students need to be proficient with technology and understand how to effectively and responsibly use digital tools.</p><p></p><p>Future Workforce Demands: The job market is continually evolving, and digital skills are in high demand across various industries. Employers are increasingly seeking candidates who have a strong foundation in digital literacy. Proficiency in areas such as coding, data analysis, digital communication, and online collaboration are considered essential for many job roles.</p><p></p><p>Access to Information: The internet has democratized access to information. It allows individuals to explore a vast array of knowledge and resources. However, to navigate and evaluate this abundance of information effectively, students need digital literacy skills. They must be able to critically analyze and verify the credibility of sources, differentiate between reliable and misleading information, and understand how to ethically and responsibly use and share digital content.</p><p></p><p>Communication and Collaboration: Digital tools have revolutionized communication and collaboration processes. Students need digital literacy skills to effectively communicate and collaborate online, whether through email, social media platforms, video conferencing, or collaborative online platforms. Understanding digital etiquette, online security, and privacy issues are essential in maintaining effective and responsible digital interactions.</p><p></p><p>Empowerment and Innovation: Digital literacy empowers students to be creators rather than just consumers of digital content. Proficiency in digital tools and creative platforms allows students to express their ideas, solve problems, and innovate. Digital literacy enables students to engage in digital storytelling, content creation, coding, and designing, thus fostering creativity and innovation.</p><br />

I began to feel a little nervous. But then I saw my parents smiling in the front row. “I can do this!” I thought to myself. When the curtain opened and the music started, I felt myconfidence grow as I remembered all the steps I had practiced.First, I heard the beat get fast, so I did a quick spin and tipped my hat.When the beat slowed down, I did a shuNe and twist. I was almost finished dancing, when suddenly, I saw that there was a loose boardat the front of the stage. But it was too late, I tripped over it and almost fell off stage! I caught myself just in time and jumped backward, pretending like it was just part of my dance. The music ended and I bowed. Everyone inthe audience jumped to their feet and clapped. My parents were cheering loudest of all. I was so happy that I did a little jig and smiled before walking off stage. After the performance was over, my coach gave me a pat on theback and said, “Nice job, Marcus!” My parents were so proud of me, they took me to get ice cream​</h2><br />

Kemudian isi T-chart dengan contoh sebab dan akibat yang Anda identifikasi dalam cerita. Hari ini adalah hari pertunjukan tarian besarku! Saya telah berlatih selama berminggu-minggu dan saya telah menghafal seluruh tarian. Ketika saya sampai di aula pertunjukan, saya memakai sepatu dan topi baru saya. Aku memeriksa bayanganku di cermin. “Aku terlihat bagus!” pikirku sambil tersenyum. Sudah hampir giliranku untuk tampil, jadi aku mengintip dari balik tirai. Ada begitu banyak orang di antara penonton! Saya mulai merasa sedikit gugup. Tapi kemudian saya melihat orang tua saya tersenyum di barisan depan. "Aku bisa melakukan ini!" Saya berpikir sendiri. Ketika tirai dibuka dan musik mulai diputar, saya merasakan kepercayaan diri saya tumbuh ketika saya mengingat semua langkah yang telah saya latih. Pertama, saya mendengar ketukan menjadi cepat, jadi saya berputar cepat dan mengangkat topi saya. Saat irama melambat, saya melakukan shuNe dan twist. Saya hampir selesai menari, ketika tiba-tiba, saya melihat ada papan lepas di depan panggung. Tapi sudah terlambat, saya tersandung dan hampir jatuh dari panggung! Aku menangkap diriku tepat pada waktunya dan melompat mundur, berpura-pura seperti itu hanya bagian dari tarianku. Musik berakhir dan saya membungkuk. Semua orang di antara penonton melompat berdiri dan bertepuk tangan. Orang tuaku bersorak paling keras. Saya sangat senang bahwa saya melakukan sedikit jig dan tersenyum sebelum berjalan dari panggung. Setelah pertunjukan selesai, pelatih saya menepuk punggung saya dan berkata, "Kerja bagus, Marcus!" Orang tua saya sangat bangga dengan saya, mereka membawa saya untuk mendapatkan es krim</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Two days ago I was in the bus station to pick my brother up for his arrival.
I was playing my phone all the time in that afternoon. I sat in the bench right near the ticket keeper. Then, I bought a bottle of water across the ticket keeper. I forgot to take my phone with me when I bought water. Then I saw my brother out of the bus. I ran to him and we were about to go. That time I thought I lost my phone. My brother told me to check it in the place before. I came back and the ticket keeper told me that he saved the phone for me. I thanked him and we said our good bye.
I was afraid that I would lose my phone. Lucky I still had it back.</h2><br />
