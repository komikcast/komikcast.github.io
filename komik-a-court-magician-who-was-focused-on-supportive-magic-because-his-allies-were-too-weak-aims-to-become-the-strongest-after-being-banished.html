With his bravery, Malin Kundang helped the merchant defeat the pirates. To thank him, the merchant allowed Malin Kundang to sail with him. Malin Kundang agreed in the hope to get a better life. He left his mother alone. Many years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had a huge ship and a lot of crews who worked loading trading goods. He was also married to a beautiful woman. When he was sailing on his trading journey, his ship landed on a coast near a small village. The local people recognized that it was Malin Kundang, a boy from the area. The news ran fast in the town; "Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here". An old woman, who was Malin Kundang's mother, ran to the beach to meet the new rich merchant.

                                            SINGAPORE : a supervisor was jailed for two months for repeatedly striking his Indonesian maid on the head and back with a television remote.
Muhammad Shafiq Woon Abdullah was brought to court in Singapore because he had physically hurt the woman in several occasions between June and October 2002, the Straits Time said.
The magistrate’s court heard that Shafiq, 31 began striking Winarti, 22, about a month after she started working for him.
He hit her on the head with the TV sets remote control because he was unhappy with her work. On one occasion, he punched her in the back after accusing her of daydreaming. S.S. Dhilon. Shafiq’s lawyer said that his client had become mad when he saw his daughter’s face covered as she was lying in bed. He said his client thought the maid had the child in danger.

The king finally decided to adopt a son who will be a prince. Then the king held an announcement to all the boys in his kingdom that he was looking for someone to be adopted as his son. All the boys in the country got together to meet the king. The king became confused because there were many boys proposed themselves as a potential prince. Then he thought so hard to find the boy who deserves to be a prince. Finally, the king got an idea. He distributed seeds to all the boys. Then he said that anyone who could grow the seeds into beautiful flowers would become the prince.

All the boys in the country got together to meet the king. The king became confused because there were many boys proposed themselves as a potential prince.

                            40. Who was the owner of the magic candle?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Who was the owner of the magic candle?
</strong></p><p>The owner of the magic candle in the story entitled “The Magic Candle” is an old woman.
</p><p>Terjemahan: Pemilik dari lilin ajaib dalam cerita yang berjudul “Lilin Ajaib” adalah seorang wanita tua.
</p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Jawaban untuk pertanyaan ini dapat kamu temukan dalam cerita “The Magic Candle” berikut ceritanya.
</p><p>
</p><p>One day, a young wanderer got lost in the wood. Suddenly, he saw a light from an old hut. He knocked on the door, and old woman opened it. She was crying.
</p><p>
</p><p>She said that a devil had stolen her magic candle. The candle could grant anything she asked. The wanderer asked her where the devil lived. “in a castle not far from here,” said the old woman.
</p><p>
</p><p>The wanderer went to the castle. There he found the devil, but he was old and weak. Therefore, when the wanderer grabbed the magic candle from the devil’s table and ran away, he couldn’t chase him.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, the wanderer was not a kind man. He didn’t return the candle to the old woman, but kept it for himself. He lit the candle and made a wish, “I want to go far away from here.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Suddenly, a genie appeared and took him to a beautiful palace. The wanderer wanted to make some money. So, he lit the candle again and wished for some jewelry.
</p><p>
</p><p>He sold them to the guests and was soon making a lot of money. Then, a princess came to buy some jewelry, but there was nothing left.
</p><p>
</p><p>The wanderer fell in love with her and asked her to marry him. The kind princess said yes, and they got married the next day.
</p><p>
</p><p>In his happiness, the wanderer told the princess about his adventure and the magic candle. Hearing that, the princess got very angry. At night, she lit the candle and wished the wanderer disappeared.
</p><p>In the morning the wanderer awoke and found himself back in his ugly house in the village.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Dalam paragraf kedua cerita tersebut yang berisi “She said that a devil had stolen her magic candle” dikatakan bahwa si wanita tua kehilangan lilin ajaibnya karena dicuri oleh seorang iblis. Dari sini, dapat disimpulkan bahwa si wanita tua merupakan pemiliki dari lilin ajaib tersebut.
