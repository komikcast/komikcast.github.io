                                            A. Read the text below carefully! Little Red Riding Hood Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near a big forest. Her grandma had made her a beautiful red cloak with a big red hood. The little girl wore every time she went outside. Therefore, everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood. One day, the little girl's mother said to the Little Red Riding Hood, "Grandma isn't feeling very well. Will you take this basket of food through the forest to her cottage, Darling?" "Yes," said Little Red Riding Hood. "I also want to see grandma." Then she put on her red cloak and pulled up her red hood. After that, she took the basket of food. "Remember, don't talk to any strangers along the way," her mother advised. "I won't!" Little Red Riding Hood promised. Then she skipped down the path and went into the woods. She remembered the way to grandma's house very well. On her way, she saw some beautiful wildflowers growing near the path. "I bet grandma would really like these flowers," she said to herself. When she was picking up the flowers, a voice startled her. "Hello, little girl," said a deep growling voice behind her. Little Red Riding Hood turned around and saw a big wolf. "Hello," said Little Red Riding Hood. She did not know the wolf was bad, and she had already forgotten her mother's words. "Where are you going on this fine day?" asked the wolf. "I'm going to my grandma's house on the other side of the forest. She isn't feeling well, so I'm bringing her this basket of food. I also have some flowers to her," said Little Red Riding Hood. "What a sweet girl you are!" said the wolf. "I had to go. Goodbye, Mr. Wolf," said the little girl. The wolf was quite hungry but he was not interested in the basket of food. Suddenly, the wolf had an idea. He ran through the forest as quick as he could to the grandma's cottage. He finally arrived there before the Little Red Riding Hood. He opened the door very quietly and found grandma asleep in her bed. Then he swallowed poor grandma in one gulp. Then the wolf climbed into the bed and pulled the blanket up to his chin. He put on grandma's glasses and her night cap. And he waited for the little girl to arrive. When Little Red Riding Hood arrived at the house, she opened the door quietly and found grandma lying in bed. "Hello, Grandma. Mother told me you weren't feeling well, so I brought you some food and flowers", she said. "What a sweet little girl you are!" said the wolf in his fake-grandma voice. Then he asked the little girl to come closer. As Little Red Riding Hood took a step closer, she noticed that something looked a little different about grandma. She was surprised and said that the eyes and the ears were bigger. However, the wolf could answer her questions. When the wolf pulled down the blanket, the little girl was surprised and said, "What big ears you have, Grandma!" "All the better to eat you with," groweld the wolf and then he jumped out of the bed and swallowed her. Outside the cottage, a woodsman was walking through the forest when he heard Little Red Riding Hood's scream. He hurried inside the house. Then the woodsman grabbed up the wolf, turned him upside down and shook him by the feet. Little Red Riding Hood came tumbling out of the wolf's mouth, and then grandma followed. The three of them chased the wolf. The wolf ran for his life and was never seen again. Finally, the Little Red Riding Hood learned her lesson and she never ever talked to strangers after that.1. Why did the villagers call the little girl Little Red Riding Hood? 2. Why did Little Red Riding Hood want to visit her grandmother? 3. What was her mother's advice? 4. How could Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother be saved? 5. What is the moral lesson of the story?​</a>

He saw the house, and he smelledthe pic inside. The wolf tried to come in but the pigs did not allow him. So he hultedand le puffed and he blew the house down. The wolf was greedy and he tried to caldiboth pigs at once, but he got neither.2 Once upon a time there were three little pigs. The first little pig was very lazy. He didn',want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked auirtle bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Thethird little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy housecomplete with a fine fireplace and chimney.3 The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; andhe saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would makea mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water. So he knocked on the door and said,Little pig. Let me in!" The little pig answered back, "No! No! No!". He huffed and blewthe house down! The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could,but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.4 The wolf chased them down the lane to the brick house. The wolf knocked on the door andsaid. Little pigs! Let me in! The little pigs did not open it. He huffed and he puffed, but hecould not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff andhe couldn't putt anymore. Knowing that he could not break in the wolf went away.​</a>

                            16. A. Read the text below carefully! Little Red Riding Hood Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near a big forest. Her grandma had made her a beautiful red cloak with a big red hood. The little girl wore every time she went outside. Therefore, everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood. One day, the little girl's mother said to the Little Red Riding Hood, "Grandma isn't feeling very well. Will you take this basket of food through the forest to her cottage, Darling?" "Yes," said Little Red Riding Hood. "I also want to see grandma." Then she put on her red cloak and pulled up her red hood. After that, she took the basket of food. "Remember, don't talk to any strangers along the way," her mother advised. "I won't!" Little Red Riding Hood promised. Then she skipped down the path and went into the woods. She remembered the way to grandma's house very well. On her way, she saw some beautiful wildflowers growing near the path. "I bet grandma would really like these flowers," she said to herself. When she was picking up the flowers, a voice startled her. "Hello, little girl," said a deep growling voice behind her. Little Red Riding Hood turned around and saw a big wolf. "Hello," said Little Red Riding Hood. She did not know the wolf was bad, and she had already forgotten her mother's words. "Where are you going on this fine day?" asked the wolf. "I'm going to my grandma's house on the other side of the forest. She isn't feeling well, so I'm bringing her this basket of food. I also have some flowers to her," said Little Red Riding Hood. "What a sweet girl you are!" said the wolf. "I had to go. Goodbye, Mr. Wolf," said the little girl. The wolf was quite hungry but he was not interested in the basket of food. Suddenly, the wolf had an idea. He ran through the forest as quick as he could to the grandma's cottage. He finally arrived there before the Little Red Riding Hood. He opened the door very quietly and found grandma asleep in her bed. Then he swallowed poor grandma in one gulp. Then the wolf climbed into the bed and pulled the blanket up to his chin. He put on grandma's glasses and her night cap. And he waited for the little girl to arrive. When Little Red Riding Hood arrived at the house, she opened the door quietly and found grandma lying in bed. "Hello, Grandma. Mother told me you weren't feeling well, so I brought you some food and flowers", she said. "What a sweet little girl you are!" said the wolf in his fake-grandma voice. Then he asked the little girl to come closer. As Little Red Riding Hood took a step closer, she noticed that something looked a little different about grandma. She was surprised and said that the eyes and the ears were bigger. However, the wolf could answer her questions. When the wolf pulled down the blanket, the little girl was surprised and said, "What big ears you have, Grandma!" "All the better to eat you with," groweld the wolf and then he jumped out of the bed and swallowed her. Outside the cottage, a woodsman was walking through the forest when he heard Little Red Riding Hood's scream. He hurried inside the house. Then the woodsman grabbed up the wolf, turned him upside down and shook him by the feet. Little Red Riding Hood came tumbling out of the wolf's mouth, and then grandma followed. The three of them chased the wolf. The wolf ran for his life and was never seen again. Finally, the Little Red Riding Hood learned her lesson and she never ever talked to strangers after that.1. Why did the villagers call the little girl Little Red Riding Hood? 2. Why did Little Red Riding Hood want to visit her grandmother? 3. What was her mother's advice? 4. How could Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother be saved? 5. What is the moral lesson of the story?​</h2><br />

The wolf tried to come in but the pigs did not allow him. So he hultedand le puffed and he blew the house down. The wolf was greedy and he tried to caldiboth pigs at once, but he got neither.2 Once upon a time there were three little pigs. The first little pig was very lazy. He didn',want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked auirtle bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Thethird little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy housecomplete with a fine fireplace and chimney.3 The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; andhe saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would makea mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water. So he knocked on the door and said,Little pig. Let me in!" The little pig answered back, "No! No! No!". He huffed and blewthe house down! The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could,but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.4 The wolf chased them down the lane to the brick house. The wolf knocked on the door andsaid. Little pigs! Let me in! The little pigs did not open it. He huffed and he puffed, but hecould not blow the house down.
