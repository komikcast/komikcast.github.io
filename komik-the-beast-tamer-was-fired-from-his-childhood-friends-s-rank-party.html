She was also a hard working girl. She always helped her father in the farm.        One day her father went out for the city. He saw an old castle. He became curious to know who lived inside, and he went in. While he was walking around the castle, he met nobody inside. Knowing that there was none inside, he ate the food on the table and picked a rose from the garden, for Beauty. Then an angry beast appeared and wanted to kill him unless Beauty was brought to him.        After reaching his home, Beauty's father told her the truth. Beauty loved her father very much, so she didn't refuse what her father asked. She went to the Beast castle and lived there only with the Beast. Her gloomy life had begun since then. She often tried to run away but she was always successfully stopped by the Beast.        The Beast loved beauty very much. Because of his treatment, Beauty began to like him too. One day, when beauty visiting her father in the village because of his illness, she had a dream. She saw the Beast was dying. She suddenly came back to the Beast castle. Seeing the "dying Beast" she began to cry. When her tear was falling on to the Beast, he became a handsome prince.        Beauty and the Beast got married and lived happily ever after. (Adapter from Beauty and The Beast movie review) Which of the following is not true according to the text?A.Beauty's father had almost been killed by the Beast.B.Beauty finally got married without feeling love.C.Beauty often failed to escape from the Beast.D.Beauty finally loved the Beast.E.Beauty had two sisters.​</a>

He became curious to know who lived inside, and he went in. While he was walking around the castle, he met nobody inside. Knowing that there was none inside, he ate the food on the table and picked a rose from the garden, for Beauty. Then an angry beast appeared and wanted to kill him unless Beauty was brought to him.        After reaching his home, Beauty's father told her the truth. Beauty loved her father very much, so she didn't refuse what her father asked. She went to the Beast castle and lived there only with the Beast. Her gloomy life had begun since then. She often tried to run away but she was always successfully stopped by the Beast.        The Beast loved beauty very much. Because of his treatment, Beauty began to like him too. One day, when beauty visiting her father in the village because of his illness, she had a dream. She saw the Beast was dying. She suddenly came back to the Beast castle.

When her tear was falling on to the Beast, he became a handsome prince.        Beauty and the Beast got married and lived happily ever after. (Adapter from Beauty and The Beast movie review) Which of the following is not true according to the text?A.Beauty's father had almost been killed by the Beast.B.Beauty finally got married without feeling love.C.Beauty often failed to escape from the Beast.D.Beauty finally loved the Beast.E.Beauty had two sisters.​</h2><br />
