Then, the greedy brotherand his wife offered the younger brother to trade all their fortune for thestar-fruit tree. The younger brother gladly accepted the offer. Soon theolder brother and his family moved to the house with the star-fruit tree.When the raven came for the star fruits, the older brother made the sameplea. As expected, the raven told him to bring a 1-meter long bag.Because he was greedy, he asked his wife to make a much longer bag.When the bag was done, he climbed on the raven's back and then theyflew to the place full of gold. He filled the big bag with gold. He alsobrought some gold in his pockets. On the way home, the load soonbecame too heavy for the raven. Unable to hang on, the raven swayed, andthe greedy brother fell straight down to the sea with his bag and pocketsfull of gold. He sank very fast down the sea. The older brother finally died.He died because of his greediness.Adapted from: www.vietspring.org/legend/caykhe.html,visited on 10 October 2014 at 10.44 pm​</a>

The big brother took almost everything. He gave his younger brother only a small piece of land, with a star-fruit tree in front of it. From then on the younger one lived there and made his living only by selling star fruits from the tree. The star fruit tree had an exceptional amount of fruits. Unfortunately, a very big raven often came and ate all the ripe fruits. At first he was too afraid of the raven, and did not know what to do. But one day he dared to approach the raven. He begged to it not to eat the fruits. Surprisingly the raven was not angry. He said that he will pay the fruits with gold. From then on, the younger brother and his family could live happily in luxury. On the commemoration of his father’s death, the younger brother invited his older brother to come to his house. At first the big brother refused to come. But because his younger brother insisted, he and his wife finally decided to come.

                            35. A long time ago there was a rich old man living in Vietnam. He had two sons with different attitudes.The older brother was very greedy and the younger brother was very kind. When the old man died, the brothers divided his father’s wealth into two parts. The big brother took almost everything. He gave his younger brother only a small piece of land, with a star-fruit tree in front of it. From then on the younger one lived there and made his living only by selling star fruits from the tree. The star fruit tree had an exceptional amount of fruits. Unfortunately, a very big raven often came and ate all the ripe fruits. At first he was too afraid of the raven, and did not know what to do. But one day he dared to approach the raven. He begged to it not to eat the fruits. Surprisingly the raven was not angry. He said that he will pay the fruits with gold. From then on, the younger brother and his family could live happily in luxury. On the commemoration of his father’s death, the younger brother invited his older brother to come to his house. At first the big brother refused to come. But because his younger brother insisted, he and his wife finally decided to come. When they got to the younger brother’s house, they were surprised to see that he was now very rich. He asked his younger brother how he had got all his wealth and the younger brother was happy to tell him the truth.
