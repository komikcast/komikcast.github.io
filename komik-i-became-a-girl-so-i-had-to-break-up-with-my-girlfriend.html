                                             My Propose Day
I woke up at about five o'clock yesterday. It wasn't a regular day, because I was about to propose a girl. After praying and taking a bath, I had my early breakfast. At about nine o'clock I was in my office but my soul wasn't there. I was thinking about the lines that I had to say to her. At one o'clock, I had my lunch but I wasn't enjoying it either. So, I practiced the lines to almost all girls I met at my lunch. Yes, I was a little bit crazy. Finally, it was three o'clock. I remembered all my lines. I wrapped my works and got ready to pick her up and of course proposed her.
I met her at four o'clock, took a little walk and went to a movie. At seven, we had a romantic dinner. I thought it was the perfect time to ask her to be my wife. Then I said the lines that I practiced the whole afternoon. She smiled. I reached my pocket to get a ring and put it around her finger. Then she said "Yes." After driven her home I went back to my house.

                                            Tolong bantu sekarang jugaMy Holiday During my holiday break, I decided to spend some time at home. It was a welcome change from my usual routine of going to school and doing homework. I spent the first few days just relaxing and catching up on some much-needed sleep. I also spent a lot of time with my family, which was nice because we don't always get to spend as much time together as we would like. One of the things I enjoyed most about being at home was being able to cook my own meals. I love to cook, and I was able to try out some new recipes that I had been wanting to try. I also made some of my favorite dishes, like my mom's famous lasagna and my dad's delicious grilled chicken. Another thing I enjoyed was being able to catch up on some of my favorite TV shows and movies. I was able to watch a lot of new releases that I had missed while I was busy with school. I also spent some time playing video games and reading books, which was a nice way to relax and unwind. Overall, I had a great time spending my holiday break at home. It was a much-needed break from my usual routine, and it was nice to be able to spend some quality time with my family. I'm already looking forward to my next holiday at home.-cari bentuk simple past tense (V2), adverb of time (keterangan waktu)?​</a>

I woke up later than my usual habit and had a breakfast with my parents. Then I took a bath to freshen my body. After that, I played Mobile Legends on my phone until it almost midday. In the afternoon, I had lunch with my par- ents and then helped them to clean the house. After I cleaned the house, I took a nap on the couch. In the evening, I dined and then did the homework that my teacher gave me. After 1 finished my homework, I watched my favourite series on Netflix. I kept repeated the same ac- tivities during my holiday. So, I was sure that it was the most boring holiday I've ever had.​</a>

I got there in about twenty minutes. She was at home, writing letters so we had a cup of tea and watched television till about 11.30. I then left and went down to start my car. It wouldn’t start, so I spent about 20 minutes trying to fix it. I suppose that was about 10 to 12. So, before I left, I went upstairs to my girlfriend’s flat to wash my hands. She had already gone to sleep, and she didn’t hear me knocking at the door. I decided to drive home with dirty hands. I got home about a quarter past 12”tolong dibantu ya yang bisa, terima kasih banyak..​</a>

                            25.  My Propose Day
I woke up at about five o'clock yesterday. It wasn't a regular day, because I was about to propose a girl. After praying and taking a bath, I had my early breakfast. At about nine o'clock I was in my office but my soul wasn't there. I was thinking about the lines that I had to say to her. At one o'clock, I had my lunch but I wasn't enjoying it either. So, I practiced the lines to almost all girls I met at my lunch. Yes, I was a little bit crazy. Finally, it was three o'clock. I remembered all my lines. I wrapped my works and got ready to pick her up and of course proposed her.
I met her at four o'clock, took a little walk and went to a movie. At seven, we had a romantic dinner. I thought it was the perfect time to ask her to be my wife. Then I said the lines that I practiced the whole afternoon. She smiled. I reached my pocket to get a ring and put it around her finger. Then she said "Yes." After driven her home I went back to my house.

                            29. Tolong bantu sekarang jugaMy Holiday During my holiday break, I decided to spend some time at home. It was a welcome change from my usual routine of going to school and doing homework. I spent the first few days just relaxing and catching up on some much-needed sleep. I also spent a lot of time with my family, which was nice because we don't always get to spend as much time together as we would like. One of the things I enjoyed most about being at home was being able to cook my own meals. I love to cook, and I was able to try out some new recipes that I had been wanting to try. I also made some of my favorite dishes, like my mom's famous lasagna and my dad's delicious grilled chicken. Another thing I enjoyed was being able to catch up on some of my favorite TV shows and movies. I was able to watch a lot of new releases that I had missed while I was busy with school. I also spent some time playing video games and reading books, which was a nice way to relax and unwind. Overall, I had a great time spending my holiday break at home. It was a much-needed break from my usual routine, and it was nice to be able to spend some quality time with my family. I'm already looking forward to my next holiday at home.-cari bentuk simple past tense (V2), adverb of time (keterangan waktu)?​</h2><br />

I got there in about twenty minutes. She was at home, writing letters so we had a cup of tea and watched television till about 11.30. I then left and went down to start my car. It wouldn’t start, so I spent about 20 minutes trying to fix it. I suppose that was about 10 to 12. So, before I left, I went upstairs to my girlfriend’s flat to wash my hands. She had already gone to sleep, and she didn’t hear me knocking at the door. I decided to drive home with dirty hands. I got home about a quarter past 12”tolong dibantu ya yang bisa, terima kasih banyak..​</h2><br />
